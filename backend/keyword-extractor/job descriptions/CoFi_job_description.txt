Full-Stack Software Developer

About CoFi

CoFi is a fintech company transforming how construction lending and payments work. We build software that helps lenders, builders, and contractors manage the complex financial workflows of construction projects—from loan origination through draw management and payments. Our platform simplifies processes that have traditionally been manual, paper-heavy, and error-prone.

About the Role

We're looking for a Full-Stack Developer to help us build and scale our construction finance platform. You'll work across the stack—crafting intuitive interfaces for lenders and contractors while developing the robust backend systems that handle loan workflows, payment processing, and document management. This is an opportunity to solve real problems in an industry that's ripe for modernization.

What You'll Do
Build React interfaces that make complex lending workflows feel simple for users
Develop and maintain backend services and APIs using C# and .NET
Work on features across our platform including loan origination, draw management, and payment systems
Participate in system design discussions, helping shape how we architect solutions for financial workflows
Integrate with third-party services for banking, identity verification, and document processing
Write secure, reliable code—financial software demands a high bar for quality
Collaborate with product and design to understand the needs of lenders, builders, and contractors
What We're Looking For

Required

2–4 years of professional experience building full-stack web applications
Strong proficiency with React, including hooks, state management, and component design
Solid experience with C# and .NET for backend development
Understanding of RESTful API design and implementation
Experience with relational databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or similar)
Ability to reason about system design and make pragmatic architectural decisions
Attention to detail—accuracy matters when you're building financial software

Nice to Have

Experience with Google Cloud Platform services
Familiarity with Kubernetes and containerized deployments
Background in fintech, lending, payments, or other regulated industries
Experience integrating with banking or payment APIs (Plaid, Dwolla, or similar)
Exposure to document processing or workflow automation
What You Bring
Comfort navigating complex business domains and translating requirements into software
A collaborative mindset and clear communication skills
Ownership over your work and pride in shipping reliable features
Curiosity about construction finance—you don't need to be an expert, but you're eager to learn how the industry works
