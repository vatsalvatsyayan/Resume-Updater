About The Team

The Knowledge Innovation team is scaling OpenAI with OpenAI. We are building an AI powered knowledge system that evolves and learns as our products, systems and customers evolve. We leverage our state of the art models, technologies, and products (some external, some still in the lab) to assist or completely automate robust operations supporting both internal and external customers. We support OpenAI customers and internal partners globally, powering systems from customer support to integrity to product insights. We are a self-contained multi-disciplinary team, who enjoy a lightning fast feedback loop with customers at scale, some of whom sit just a few pods away. We iterate fast, and engineer for reliable long-term impact. We're constantly looking for the similarities and patterns in different types of work, and focus on building simple primitives, to apply world class knowledge to many domains.

The work of this team exemplifies use of OpenAI technologies. We build systems so everyone can see the leverage that is possible with well designed AI-based implementations. We do this by working through internal use cases focused on Customers (specifically knowledge systems, automation systems, and automated agent systems) to prove impact, then we scale.

About The Role

We’re looking for Full Stack Engineers who're passionate about blending production-ready platform architecture with new tech and new paradigms. You’ll push the boundaries of OpenAI’s newest technologies to enable interactions and automations that are not only functional, but delightful. We value proactive, customer-centric engineers who can get the foundational details right (data models, architecture, security) in service of enabling great products.

In This Role, You Will


Own the end-to-end development lifecycle for new platform capabilities and integrations with other systems
Collaborate closely with engineers, data scientists, information systems architects, and internal customers to understand their problems and implement effective solutions
Work with product and research team to share relevant feedback and iterate on applying their latest models
