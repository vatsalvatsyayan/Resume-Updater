About the job

About the Role

A1 is building a proactive AI system that carries work forward across conversations, tools, and time.

You will build the systems that power every AI interaction users experience. Your work will sit at the intersection of models, orchestration, APIs, and product behavior - where correctness, latency, and reliability actually matter.




Focus
Build and operate backend systems that serve AI-powered features in production.
Design inference pipelines, orchestration layers, and service boundaries around models.
Own production concerns: monitoring, logging, alerting, and incident response.
Optimize latency and throughput across inference, caching, batching, and streaming.




Ideal Experiences
Strong backend engineering fundamentals in production environments.
Experience running high-throughput, low-latency services.
Familiarity with AI inference patterns (LLMs, embeddings, multimodal).
Comfortable debugging distributed systems under load.
Bias toward shipping and learning from production behavior.




Tech Stack
Python
NodeJs
Pytorch
OpenAI / Anthropic / open-source LLMs
SQl & noSQL
Kubernetes
Docker
