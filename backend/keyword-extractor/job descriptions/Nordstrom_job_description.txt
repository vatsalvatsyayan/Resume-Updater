About the job

At Nordstrom, we're building the next generation of in-store selling tools to support exceptional customer service across more than 350 locations. Our POS+ team is focused on delivering fast, secure, and modern point-of-sale experiences. We're reimagining retail transactions through a scalable platform powered by a React front end and a Java/Spring Boot backend, hosted in AWS and integrated with store hardware and cloud-native services.

We're looking for an Engineer 1 to join our full-stack engineering team to help develop and support the suite of POS+ applications used daily by store teams. You'll work collaboratively using technologies like React, Java, Spring Boot, AWS, Kafka, and Kubernetes, contributing to critical in-store workflows from login to receipts. This is a hands-on engineering role with mentorship and support from senior engineers, offering the opportunity to build reliable and performant software used at scale.

What You'll Do...


Build, test, and support web applications and APIs that are stable, maintainable, and secure.
Write clean, well-documented code using React and Java following engineering best practices.
To ensure software quality and reliability, contribute to test automation (unit, integration, and end-to-end).
Learn and apply cloud-native development patterns (AWS, containers, CI/CD pipelines).
Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and collaborative development with other engineers.
Investigate and troubleshoot issues, optimize system performance, and support store operations when needed.
Rotate through on-call responsibilities for production support.


What We're Looking For...


Bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, Engineering, or equivalent practical experience (required).
Some hands-on coding experience in internships, academic projects, or personal development with React, Java, and JavaScript.
Familiarity with modern front-end development frameworks and workflows (React, Redux) is a plus.
Strong desire to learn full-stack development and work across front-end, backend, and cloud services.
Interest in building real-world software that directly impacts store teams and customers.


Join us if you're excited to be part of a high-impact, collaborative engineering team modernizing the future of retail experiences—starting at the register.
