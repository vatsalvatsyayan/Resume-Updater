Our products enable law firms to secure faster settlements, higher payouts, and better outcomes for victims injured through no fault of their own in vehicle collisions, accidents, natural disasters, and more.

We are one of the fastest-growing vertical SaaS companies in history, and we are just getting started. EvenUp is backed by top VCs, including Bessemer Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, SignalFire, and Lightspeed. We are looking to expand our team with talented, driven, and collaborative individuals who seek to have a lasting impact. Learn more at www.evenuplaw.com.

🎥 Life as an Engineer at EvenUp

Location & Work Model

This is a hybrid role, with an expectation of being in our SF office three days per week.

About The Team

The New Products Engineering team is responsible for building and launching entirely new products that directly impact how personal injury attorneys serve their clients. Over the past year, EvenUp’s engineering and data science organization has grown rapidly — from 40 to 100+ team members — alongside major infrastructure investments, new product launches, and significant workflow improvements across data, ML, frontend, and backend systems.

Over the next 12 months, the team will continue to scale as we deliver on an ambitious roadmap to handle 10x our current volume and introduce new AI-powered products. The work this team does directly influences customer workflows and outcomes, ultimately impacting millions of people navigating the personal injury system. A true zero-to-one product focus with high ownership and autonomy, deep collaboration across engineering, product, data, ML, and operations, and a rare opportunity to modernize a historically analog industry at scale.

Responsibilities


Own and evolve core systems and product workflows that support the launch of new customer-facing products
Partner closely with Product, Design, Data Science, and other Engineering teams to bring new ideas from concept to production
Contribute to scalable, reliable, and high-quality software that can support rapid growth and increasing complexity
Drive projects end-to-end, from early design and architecture through delivery and iteration
Uphold high standards for performance, reliability, security, and maintainability
Contribute to a strong, collaborative, and inclusive engineering culture


What You’ll Do


Execution & Delivery: Build, ship, and iterate on new features and products that directly impact customer workflows. Start contributing production code quickly and help establish strong foundations for new systems
Architecture & Quality: Design, implement, and maintain scalable and maintainable backend, frontend, or full-stack systems. Write high-quality, well-tested, and production-ready code. Help define and reinforce engineering best practices as the team scales
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with Product Managers, Designers, Data Scientists, and other Engineers to scope and deliver impactful solutions. Communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ownership & Growth: Own projects from start to finish and drive them across the finish line. Mentor and support teammates, contributing to continuous learning and improvement. Learn and apply new technologies across the stack, including ML-adjacent systems, data pipelines, and DevOps workflows
Tech Stack Exposure: Python, TypeScript, React, Postgres, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, and more


What We Look For


Experience building high-quality, production-ready software in backend, frontend, or full-stack environments
Strong understanding of software design, data modeling, and system architecture
Ability to operate effectively in fast-paced, ambiguous environments
Proven ability to own projects end-to-end and deliver meaningful outcomes
Clear, thoughtful communication and strong cross-functional collaboration skills
High ownership, accountability, and a bias toward action
Demonstrated commitment to engineering excellence and team culture


Bonus (Nice to Have)


Experience with Kubernetes or cloud-native infrastructure
Exposure to machine learning, data engineering, or AI-driven products
Prior experience in startups, scale-ups, or high-growth environments
