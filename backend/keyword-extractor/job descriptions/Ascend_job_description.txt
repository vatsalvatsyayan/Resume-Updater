What We Do

Ascend is transforming the $10T global insurance industry by combining AI automation with embedded fintech.

While insurance represents 7.2% of global GDP, outdated financial infrastructure like PDFs, emails, and manual reconciliation continues to slow the industry down. Ascend is the first and market-leading finance automation platform built specifically for insurance, driving the industry's rapid digital transformation.

In just five years:


Trusted by thousands of insurance businesses nationwide 
Processes billions in transactions annually, growing 200%+ YoY 
Built a world-class team of 70+ across San Francisco and Columbus 


How We Do It

Ascend automates the insurance financial lifecycle, from collections to disbursements. We streamline operations and drive real profitability.

AI is rapidly driving the cost of software down, opening the door to faster innovation and broader access. At the same time, it is shifting where value is created. The strongest companies embed directly into financial workflows, capturing value at the point where money moves.

Ascend brings AI and fintech together to automate financial operations inside the transaction itself. Customers do not just adopt software. They unlock powerful financial efficiency with a proven 5-7x return on investment.

Why We Do It

Insurance is a $10T+ industry running on legacy systems. AI alone won't fix it, but AI-powered automation embedded into payments and transactions will.

Ascend's mission is to become the leading financial automation platform for insurance by 2030—powering the entire industry's financial operations while transforming the way trillions of dollars move.

Your Role

Ascend is hiring a Solutions Engineer (Contract) to take full ownership of a critical AI-driven data extraction workflow. You'll shape how automation powers the insurance industry—improving accuracy, scalability, and customer experience at every step.

You'll dive deep into complex data problems, fine-tune prompts, and refine systems that power the automation layer behind Ascend's financial infrastructure. This role is a mix of hands-on problem-solving, experimentation, and collaboration with Product, Operations, and Engineering teams to make our automation more reliable and intelligent.

This is a contract role based on-site at our San Francisco office, 40 hours per week for six months.

Responsibilities

Own and optimize prompt logic


Identify and resolve data extraction issues using prompt engineering and analytical problem-solving.
Design systems that enable scalable, high-accuracy iteration on prompt workflows.


Technical implementation & tooling


Partner with internal teams to improve testing, monitoring, and refinement processes.
Support new customer and organization onboarding through internal tooling improvements.
Provide feedback and insights to shape the broader product roadmap.


Customer & stakeholder collaboration


Work closely with internal and external users to gather context, troubleshoot challenges, and deliver consistent, high-quality results.


Quality assurance & reporting


Track and analyze extraction accuracy metrics, uncovering trends and root causes.
Recommend process improvements to reduce manual work over time.
Build reusable playbooks and prompt strategies to support future automation efforts.


Why This Role Matters

This is a chance to own a critical piece of Ascend's AI-powered automation systems and see your work directly impact product performance, customer satisfaction, and company growth.

You'll thrive here if you love solving tough technical problems, moving quickly, and building systems that scale intelligently. This role is perfect for someone who operates at the intersection of data, engineering, and product thinking—and takes pride in turning complexity into clarity.

What We're Looking For


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills, with a track record of breaking down complex problems into actionable solutions.
Experience with AI-powered document processing, prompt engineering, or data extraction workflows.
Proven ability to work with large, unstructured datasets to identify patterns and improve accuracy.
Strong communication skills, with the ability to translate technical concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Bonus: Familiarity with large language models (LLMs) and their applications in automation or data systems.

Location: On-site in San Francisco (SoMa)
Schedule: Full-time, 40 hours per week
Type: Contract (6 months) with full time conversion
Compensation: $35-45 per hour
Benefits Note: Healthcare Coverage, 401k, and leave are not included until converted to full time
