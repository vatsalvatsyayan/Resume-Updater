About the job

Cribl does differently.

What does that mean? It means we are a serious company that doesn’t take itself too seriously; and we’re looking for people who love to get stuff done, and laugh a bit along the way. We’re growing rapidly - looking for collaborative, curious, and motivated team members who are passionate about putting customers first. As a remote-first company we believe in empowering our employees to do their best work, wherever they are.

As the data engine for IT and Security many of the biggest names in the most demanding industries trust Cribl to solve their most pressing data needs. Ready to do the best work of your career? Join the herd and unlock your opportunity.

Why You'll Love This Role

Platform Engineering at Cribl is responsible for creating and maintaining the foundational software infrastructure that supports our entire ecosystem of products. This includes scalable systems, shared services, developer tools, and core components that other product teams rely on to build customer-facing features quickly and reliably.

As a Software Engineer I on the Core Platform team, you’ll join a group of engineers building the backend systems and APIs that ingest, process, and route massive volumes of observability and security data. This is an ideal role for someone early in their career (new grad or entry-level) who’s excited to learn, ship real features, and grow with mentorship from senior engineers.


You’ll work on real distributed backend systems that handle high-volume metrics and telemetry data, not toy problems.
You’ll have strong mentorship from senior and staff engineers, with clear expectations for learning and growth.
You’ll get exposure to time-series databases, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines, building a foundation in modern platform engineering.
You’ll be part of a remote-first team that values curiosity, collaboration, clear communication, and of course… goats.



As An Active Member Of Our Team, You Will...


Learn and contribute to backend systems and APIs that ingest, process, and route data, implementing well-scoped features and bug fixes with guidance from more senior engineers.
Design, develop, test, and maintain clear, maintainable code in Node.js/TypeScript that delivers the right outcomes for our customers, starting with smaller, well-defined tasks and growing into more complex work over time.
Collaborate with a cross-functional team of engineers, designers, and product managers to understand requirements, ask clarifying questions, and turn feature specifications into implementable stories and code.
Write and extend automated tests (unit, integration, and functional) for the code you ship, following existing test plans and patterns and contributing to new test cases as you gain experience.
Participate in code reviews: both as an author and a reviewer-in-training—incorporating feedback to improve code quality, testing, and readability while learning from more experienced teammates.
Help investigate and fix bugs in collaboration with senior engineers, learning how to use logs, metrics, and other observability tools to understand and debug distributed systems.
Support performance and correctness work around time-series data storage and query paths by pairing with teammates and tackling well-bounded tasks that improve reliability and efficiency.
Develop good engineering habits: writing tests alongside code, keeping documentation up to date, breaking problems into smaller pieces, and asking for help early when you’re stuck.
Take ownership at an appropriate scope: own your tickets, communicate status clearly, follow through on commitments, and escalate risks early; over time, grow into owning small features end to end.
Participate in the team’s support/on-call rotation over time: you’ll start by shadowing more experienced engineers and gradually take on more responsibility as you become comfortable with the systems and tooling.
Contribute to a healthy team culture by asking questions, sharing what you’re learning, and speaking up with ideas even when you’re the most junior person in the room.



If You've Got It - We Want It


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent practical experience (internships, open source, significant personal projects).
Solid CS fundamentals from coursework or experience: data structures, algorithms, basic networking and operating systems concepts, and an interest in distributed systems and scalability principles.
Experience with at least one programming language used for backend or systems work (JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java, etc.); familiarity with Node.js/TypeScript from projects, internships, or labs is a plus.
Some exposure to backend services or data-intensive applications, such as building APIs, data processing pipelines, or working with message queues and databases in school or internship work.
Familiarity with Linux or Unix-like systems as a development environment (shell basics, processes, files, simple troubleshooting).
Exposure to Docker or containerization and at least one cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) through labs, side projects, or internships is a plus.
Understanding of testing and CI/CD concepts. For example, running unit tests locally, using Git-based workflows, or working with pipelines like GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, Jenkins, or CircleCI in a school or internship setting.



Nice To Have


Curiosity about or exposure to time-series databases and columnar storage systems (e.g., ClickHouse, Prometheus, InfluxDB); hands-on experience is a plus but not expected at entry level.
Familiarity with observability tools like Grafana, Kibana/ELK, Datadog, or similar monitoring/logging stacks from classes, internships, or personal projects.
Any open source contributions, hackathon projects, or portfolio work you’re proud of.
Enjoy learning new technologies and tackling ambiguous problems with support. When you don’t know something, you’re proactive in seeking context, asking good questions, and experimenting.
Comfortable working in an Agile environment, iterating quickly, taking feedback, and improving your code and designs over time.
A strong sense of ownership at a junior scope: you care about shipping high-quality, high-performing features, even when you’re not the one designing the whole system.
And of course, a love for goats doesn’t hurt.

Competitors

Cribl operates in a highly competitive landscape dominated by established data management and observability platforms.
