On-premise issues, integrations, and environment needs for Jarvis are handled quickly with minimal disruption to the business.
Joakim and the Product team are freed up to refocus on strategic product work (including Roofing/CEM/Sales tools), rather than being blocked by day-to-day engineering tasks.

Improve operational reliability of Jarvis by implementing better monitoring, logging, and alerting for production and on-premise environments.
Lead technical implementation of key Jarvis roadmap initiatives that support events, concierge services, and sales processes.
Establish standards and processes for Jarvis development, testing, release management, and on-premise support, enabling Product (Joakim) to reengage fully on Roofing-related and other strategic projects.


COMPETENCIES


Technical Proficiency: Demonstrated experience building and maintaining production software applications (web, backend, or full-stack). Comfortable with modern programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Problem Solving: Strong analytical and debugging skills; able to quickly assess complex issues, identify root causes, and implement effective solutions.
Ownership & Accountability: Takes full responsibility for outcomes, follows through on commitments, and delivers consistently without heavy supervision.
Business Alignment: Able to understand business objectives, revenue drivers, and operational realities, and translate them into technical priorities for Jarvis.
Collaboration & Communication: Excellent communication skills; able to work closely with non-technical stakeholders, explain trade-offs, and set clear expectations.
