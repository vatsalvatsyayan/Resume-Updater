About the job

Our mission is to make exceptional healthcare accessible anytime, anywhere, for everyone.

At Assort Health, we believe healthcare should feel effortless and connected — quick answers, clear communication, and seamless access to care. That’s why we’re building a new foundation for how patients and providers connect, driven by AI, built to embrace the complexities of healthcare, and tailored to each provider’s unique needs.

Assort is the most comprehensive patient experience platform powered by specialty-specific agentic AI. Assort’s omnichannel AI agents seamlessly integrate with EHR/PMS and complicated provider preferences to eliminate lengthy hold times and inefficiencies that stand in the way of patients getting the care they need.

Since launching in 2023, Assort has managed over 90M+ patient interactions, slashing average hold times from 11 minutes to 1 minute. Our platform now handles calls for thousands of providers with 98%+ resolution rates and 99% scheduling accuracy. Patient satisfaction averages 4.4/5, and we’ve achieved 11× revenue growth since Q4 2024. We’re scaling rapidly and expanding adoption across the entire healthcare industry.

About The Role

We're on the hunt for driven, hacky and scrappy product-minded Engineers to join our team at an exciting stage of our startup's journey. If you're eager to contribute to building and scaling innovative products, this role is your ticket to making a significant impact. You'll gain hands-on experience in a dynamic startup environment, working with and contributing to cutting-edge generative AI and voice/transcription models + technologies.

As part of our first 30 Engineers, you will be a cornerstone to our company's growth and success. If you are a self-starter who is ready to wear many hats and build and scale products from zero-one, then this is the perfect role for you. You’ll have lots of autonomy and will need to be comfortable operating in ambiguous situations with an entrepreneurial mindset.

The anticipated start date for this role is Summer 2026.

What You'll Do


Be involved in key decisions alongside the founders
Work closely with our world-class engineering team to develop features and products from the ground up. 
Enjoy a high degree of autonomy, tasked with solving complex problems in innovative ways. 
Participate actively in design and development discussions, contributing fresh ideas and perspectives. 
Engage with healthcare professionals to tailor software solutions that meet real-world needs. 
Play a role in an agile team, prioritizing rapid development and deployment to meet our ambitious goals. 
You will develop scalable software solutions that comply with HIPAA and other security standards. 


What We're Looking For


Strong engineering fundamentals and a demonstrated ability to design, build, and scale production-grade applications or systems. 
Willingness to wear multiple hats—from design and development to testing and occasional support. Comfortable with rapid iteration, experimentation, and learning from failure in a fast-paced environment.
