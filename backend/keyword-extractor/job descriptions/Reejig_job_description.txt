About the job

Reejig is the Work Operating System for the AI powered enterprise.




We give companies a complete, validated view of their work by mapping every role, task, skill, and workflow. With this intelligence, we redesign how work should flow, surface where automation creates the highest leverage, and recommend the right AI agents for the enterprise. Every change is measured and tied to real operational and workforce impact.

Inside Reejig, we build the same future we sell.

We are developing our own AI powered workforce that supports our teams and our customers.

This is a place for Builders who want to help define how work will operate in the AI era.







The Role

We’re hiring a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE), Enterprise AI Agents.

You’ll work directly with enterprise customers to design, build, and deploy agents in their live environments — then translate those customer-specific solutions into scalable, reusable agent patterns for the broader platform.

You’ll sit at the boundary between product, engineering, and customer operations. You’ll operate in ambiguity, ship quickly, and feed what you learn back into our product roadmap.







What You’ll Do

Embed directly in customer environments to understand how work actually happens — systems, data, permissions, constraints, and edge cases.
Own the redesign of real enterprise workflows by introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio agents where they meaningfully change how work gets done.
Rapidly prototype, test, and iterate with customers until agents deliver clear, measurable operational impact and are generalized into best practices.




What Success Looks Like

Copilot agents running in live customer environments with measurable impact on time, cost, or quality of work.
Reusable agents and templates added to a shared library and adopted by multiple customers.
Faster customer time-to-value as learnings from one deployment compound into the platform.
Progress made without waiting for perfect requirements, perfect data, or perfect conditions.




What We’re Looking For

Strong, hands-on experience building with Microsoft Copilot Studio, Copilot agents, connectors, and integrations (real deployments, not just demos).
Experience operating inside Microsoft 365 environments, including identity, permissions, and enterprise constraints.
Comfort working directly with customers in messy, ambiguous, real-world setups.
Ability to move from a one-off customer problem to a generalized, scalable solution.
Strong execution bias: build → test → deploy → learn → repeat.
Product thinking and systems judgment — the ability to decide when AI helps, when it doesn’t, and when a simpler solution is better.




This Role Is Not For You If

You need detailed specifications before you start.
You prefer bespoke, one-off products that don’t need to scale or leverage the capability of AI platforms in a way that recognizes their current level of maturity/ability.
You want to focus on prompts, demos, or theoretical use cases rather than production agents.




Why Reejig

You’ll be building at the intersection of real enterprise work, AI agents, and measurable impact: helping define how work operates in the AI era, not just talking about it.
