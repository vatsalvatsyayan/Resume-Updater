About the job

About Us

Herald builds digital infrastructure for commercial insurance. Today we provide developers a single API to get quotes for insurance products from multiple carriers. Tomorrow we want to build anything that helps developers connect their applications to the insurance ecosystem. We think buying insurance should be as easy as buying anything else online and we want your help!

We’re a team of insurtech veterans with experience at At-Bay, Kin, and Insurify. We’ve raised our Series A funding from top-tier VCs (Lightspeed, Brewer Lane,  Afore, Underscore) along with a panel of insurtech founders (At-Bay, Marble), insurance executives (CRC), and early employees of other successful API infrastructure companies (Plaid, Alloy, Stytch).

The role

Herald is building Babbix, an AI-native platform that commercial insurance brokers use to create submissions and get quotes directly from their inbox. It orchestrates broker workflows end-to-end by combining classification pipelines, data extraction models, and a broker-facing web interface. Delivering high-quality product experiences and shipping new AI-driven capabilities are core to our success.

As a Software Engineer on the Babbix product, you’ll drive major product initiatives from inception to delivery. You’ll design, build, and scale the systems that power our AI workflows, from APIs and data pipelines to model orchestration and integration with external partners. You’ll collaborate closely with brokers and internal teams to turn ideas into production-ready features that make our AI output transparent, accurate, and trustworthy.

Why This Role Matters

Commercial insurance is one of the last major industries still powered by email. Every submission, quote, and policy must be manually processed by brokers, slowing them down and costing them deals.

By building new product and AI capabilities, you will:


Transform messy email submissions into structured, actionable data with minimal friction.
Help brokers move from inbox to quote-ready submissions in minutes instead of hours.
Enable rapid iteration on new workflows and AI features alongside our product and client services teams.
Lay the foundation for scaling Babbix across lines of business, carriers, and broker organizations.


Your work will directly impact how brokers work — transforming an industry that has been failed by modern software until now.

Life at Herald

We're just getting started and building our culture with purpose every day. One of the joys of joining a small company early is that you get to build that culture too. Come join us and help us make Herald an (even more) amazing place to work!

Actions we value

There are many actions that we hope for and even demand from members of our team: communicating honestly, working hard, behaving with integrity. These are expectations. But we value these five actions above and beyond the level of "baseline expectation." We believe that if we excel at these, our business will thrive. We’re betting the company on it.

Build trust 

We always lead with empathy. We publicly own and learn from our mistakes just as we are confident and transparent in explaining our decisions. And we help get the work done because we recognize that no job is too small.

Create a shared reality

We each articulate the facts, assumptions, questions, and fears we hold about our business. We listen to and learn from others. We create a shared set of information before making decisions.

Get better every day.

We constantly seek ways to improve ourselves. We provide each other candid feedback coupled with support to elevate those around us. We refine how we work together to become more effective as a team.

Build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community.

We thrive when our team has a variety of lived experiences, values each other for their unique perspectives, and shares equitably in our mutual success. We invest in building an inclusive community for people who are oppressed because of their race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, or socio-economic class.

(Remember that) we make the rules.

We once created the ways we work and therefore can change them. We do not default to momentum. We challenge ourselves to deconstruct the status quo and create a better future.
