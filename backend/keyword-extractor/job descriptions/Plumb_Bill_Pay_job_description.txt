About the job

Prompt/AI Engineer

Technology Division

Job Description and Ad

Full Time | Remote/On-Site in La Jolla, CA 92037




Plumb Company Overview

Plumb provides Family Office Accounting/Bill Pay services (PlumbBillPay.com). We have 50+ employees. Our 13 Principles are who we are, or at least who we strive to be, (https://www.plumbbillpay.com/plumbsguiding13principles/). Our clients are Ultra High Net Worth Individuals around the United States and some abroad. We are NOT Financial Advisors, rather, we tend to do all of the back-office accounting services and provide our clients and their advisors reporting and services.

Plumb is AI-first and AI-forward. We believe the best teams in the next decade will be the ones who can pair strong engineering judgment with modern AI tooling to ship faster, with higher quality, and with less wasted effort.







Position Description

We’re looking for a Prompt / AI Engineer who is excited by the idea of being part builder, part experimenter, and part product-thinker.

This role is intentionally R&D-flavored: you will have meaningful freedom to explore, prototype, validate, and ship AI-driven capabilities that improve productivity and operational efficiency across the business—even when requirements are not fully defined (or don’t exist yet). We want someone who naturally asks:

“Where are we spending time that we shouldn’t be spending time—and what can AI do about it?”

This is not a “research scientist” role and it’s not a “prompt-only” role either. We are not looking for PhD-level candidates writing deep learning algorithms from scratch. We are looking for savvy, high-agency AI builders who are obsessed with modern tools (ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, etc.) and who love turning messy problems into repeatable systems.

In this role, passion and applied AI savviness come before technical excellence. A computer science / developer background is strongly preferred, but we will absolutely prioritize candidates who have shipped clever, impactful AI solutions and can demonstrate great judgment, curiosity, and ownership.




What Success Looks Like

You repeatedly identify workflow bottlenecks on your own and turn them into working AI-assisted solutions.
You move from prototype → pilot → production with speed, without compromising safety or reliability.
You create “wow moments” internally—tools people actually want to use—because they save time, reduce errors, and feel magical.
Your work compounds: what you build becomes reusable infrastructure and repeatable patterns, not one-off demos.
 
 

Key Responsibilities




Applied AI R&D (Explore → Prove → Ship)

Actively hunt for opportunities to improve efficiency across operations, accounting workflows, support, and internal reporting—sometimes without being handed a formal spec.
Rapidly prototype AI solutions, validate them with real users, and iterate until they’re genuinely useful.
Build AI features that:
Extract insights from unstructured reports/documents and return structured outputs
Detect anomalies/outliers and surface “this looks wrong” items with explainable rationale
Turn voice or natural language instructions into safe, auditable actions (with confirmations and permissions)
Automate repetitive operational work while preserving control and correctness




Prompting, Tooling, and Reliability (Make it real)

Design and refine prompts, tool-calling schemas, and structured extraction pipelines that hold up under real-world messiness.
Build lightweight evaluation methods (golden sets, regression checks, failure-mode tracking) so quality improves over time.
Add guardrails: validation, safe defaults, clear fallbacks, and “I’m not sure” behaviors.




Ownership and Autonomy (High agency required)

Own projects end-to-end: problem discovery, solution design, prototyping, stakeholder feedback, iteration, and delivery.
Make pragmatic suggestions to management about what to build, what not to build, and when a solution is “good enough to ship.”
Communicate clearly: what you tried, what worked, what didn’t, and what you recommend next.

Architecture & Integration (Bonus, not a barrier)

Collaborate with engineering to integrate AI features into the product via a dedicated AI endpoint and clean service boundaries.
Think through synchronous vs. asynchronous design decisions (instant responses vs. background jobs, streaming outputs, retries, etc.).
Help ensure observability: traceability of model calls, cost/latency awareness, and production monitoring.




Internal Resources

Healthy, ongoing sales pipeline of new clients onboarding monthly.
Internal software development team automating various components of our operations’ delivery system.
Great core group of operational leaders.




Skillsets and Recommended Requirements

Required

Proof that you’ve completed projects where AI meaningfully improved a workflow, such as:
Automated insights extraction from reports, documents, emails, or spreadsheets
Outlier/anomaly detection that reduced review time or prevented errors
Natural language / voice-driven automations that trigger real actions safely
Strong familiarity with modern AI tools and LLM ecosystems (ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, etc.) and the instinct to use them creatively.
A builder mindset: you don’t just talk about ideas—you make them real, test them, and refine them.

Strongly Preferred (but not mandatory)

Software engineering background (CS, backend, full-stack, systems) and comfort working in production environments.
Experience designing APIs/services and integrating AI into existing systems.
Some experience with observability/debugging in production (logs, traces, error analysis).

Nice-to-Have

FinTech/accounting workflow familiarity.
Speech-to-text / voice UX experience.
Familiarity with privacy/security considerations in AI systems (PII, access control, audit logs).

What We Care About (Non-Negotiables Culturally)

You buy into what we're building and care about the mission.
You move with urgency, but you don't create chaos.
You're proactive and high-agency—you create clarity where none exists.
You're excited to build “cool” internal products that make people faster and happier.
You want ownership, freedom, and responsibility—and you thrive in that environment.

Founded in 1996, Plumb Bill Pay started as an outsourced accounting firm with a primary focus on providing fractional Controller-level services to small and medium-sized companies. Over the years, we discovered that when CEOs sold their businesses or retired, they no longer had their corporate accountant to help with day-to-day financial tasks. This revelation sparked Plumb to establish its family CFO and Bill Pay division.

Our purpose and vision is to consistently deliver transformational and innovative accounting products and services, so you can pursue your passion—at work, in business, and wherever we apply our services. 

Our Promise is to provide stewardship and clarity through our accounting services and technology products. We serve with stewardship in accounting that creates clarity for customers.
