We’re looking for a sharp, product-minded Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Python) who loves building developer-facing applications and services—and brings solid CI/CD and automation experience. You’ll design and deliver internal web apps, APIs, and tools that streamline our software development lifecycle while integrating tightly with modern pipelines and platforms.

Responsibilities:


Build Developer Apps & Services: Design, implement, and operate internal web applications, REST/gRPC APIs, and microservices in Go and Python that improve developer velocity, release quality, and HW/SW integration. 
Own the Full Stack: Take features from architecture and coding through testing, deployment, observability, and ongoing support; contribute across backend, APIs, and pragmatic UIs. 
CI/CD-Integrated Delivery: Use pipeline-as-code (e.g., Jenkins or equivalent) to enable automated builds, tests, security scans, artifact management, and progressive delivery. 
Data & Integrations: Work with relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL), caching (e.g., Redis), and messaging where useful; integrate with internal services and repositories (e.g., Git/Gerrit) and artifact systems (e.g., JFrog Artifactory). 
Frontend Where It Counts: Build clear, efficient UIs (e.g., React/TypeScript or similar) that make complex workflows simple for engineering teams. 
Automation & Platform Enablement: Author command-line tools, SDKs, and libraries in Go/Python to automate provisioning, configuration, orchestration, monitoring, and security hardening across heterogeneous environments. 
Collaborate Globally: Partner with cross-functional teams and stakeholders worldwide to identify gaps, prioritize improvements, and drive adoption of modern engineering practices. 
Document & Educate: Produce concise documentation and run workshops so teams can self-serve platform capabilities and best practices. 
Monitor & Measure: Instrument services with robust logging, metrics, tracing, dashboards, and alerts to ensure performance, reliability, and security across on-prem and cloud environments. 


Required Skills & Experience:


Go & Python Expertise: Proven experience building and maintaining production services and automation in Go and Python, with a test-driven mindset. 
Modern Web Fundamentals: Experience with frameworks such as FastAPI/Flask (Python) and Gin/Fiber/Echo (Go); designing clean REST/gRPC APIs. 
CI/CD Pipelines: Hands-on experience creating and operating pipelines (e.g., Jenkins pipeline-as-code or equivalent). 
Systems Fundamentals: BS in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field and a solid background in Linux-based development or system administration. 
Collaboration & Communication: Comfortable working across diverse, global teams and articulating technical concepts clearly. 
Version Control: Deep knowledge of Git (and familiarity with Gerrit/SVN) and code review workflows. 


Preferred Skills & Experience:


Multi-Platform Environments: Experience building and supporting solutions across Linux, Windows, and macOS. 
Containerization & Orchestration: Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes; deploying services to cloud platforms such as AWS. 
Infrastructure-as-Code: Experience with Ansible or Puppet (and/or Terraform) to scale repeatable environments across hybrid on-prem/cloud. 
Build & Packaging: Working with complex build systems, package managers, artifact repositories (e.g., JFrog Artifactory), and security scanning. 
Observability: Designing effective monitoring and logging with custom metrics and intuitive dashboards. 
Performance & Concurrency (Go): Profiling (e.g., pprof), tuning, and idiomatic use of goroutines/channels.
