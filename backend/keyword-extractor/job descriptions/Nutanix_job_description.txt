The Opportunity

Are you a flexible and adaptable software engineer with a strong problem-solving attitude and a passion for engaging with customers? If so, you’ll thrive in our collaborative and supportive environment, where you’ll have the opportunity to learn new technologies, solve real customer challenges, and contribute to innovative cloud solutions at Nutanix.

About The Team

The role will be part of the NC2 team, based in San Jose, California. This team focuses on deploying and integrating hybrid cloud solutions that mesh seamlessly with existing infrastructure and public cloud offerings. The culture within the team is collaborative, as members work closely with one another and with other Nutanix engineering teams. The mission at Nutanix is to drive innovation and provide robust cloud services that enhance efficiency and operational capabilities across various platforms.

You will report to a Director of Engineering, who emphasizes a strong work-life balance and prioritizes the well-being of team members. The manager encourages an open and adaptive leadership style, focusing on mentorship and support to help team members thrive. The position is hybrid, requiring the hire to work from the office two days a week initially, with plans to adjust to three days in the near future. While travel cannot be ruled out, it is expected to be very minimal.

Your Role

Operationalize enhancements from cloud providers to improve functionality.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to advance control and management planes.
Support onboarding of new cloud services.

Contribute to a continuous pipeline of features, enhancements, and compliance updates.
Participate in team discussions to strategize and shape future developments and integrations. 


What You Will Bring


Bachelor's/Master's in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related field, up to 3 years of experience in a product-focused environment.
Proficiency in Python and Go programming languages.
Understanding of distributed systems and cloud networking concepts.
Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to engage with customers effectively.
Flexibility and adaptability to learn new technologies quickly.
Experience with cloud platforms such as GCP, AWS, or Azure is a plus.
High energy and enthusiasm for continuous learning and growth.
Ability to collaborate effectively within a team-oriented environment.


Work Arrangement

In locations where our workplace policy applies (i.e. San Jose, Durham, Mexico City, Bangalore, Pune, Hoofddorp, Belgrade, Barcelona, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo), employees are expected to work onsite a minimum of 3 days per week to foster collaboration, team alignment, and access to in-office resources. Workplace type may vary based on location and team requirements. Please speak with your recruiter for details. Additional team-specific guidance and norms will be provided by your manager.

The pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between USD $ 109,600 and USD $ 218,400 per year.

However, base pay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The total compensation package for this position may also include other elements, including a sign-on bonus, restricted stock units, and discretionary awards in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits (including 401(k) eligibility and various paid time off benefits, such as vacation, sick time, and parental leave), dependent on the position offered. Details of participation in these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment.

If hired, employee will be in an “at-will position” and the Company reserves the right to modify base salary (as well as any other discretionary payment or compensation program) at any time, including for reasons related to individual performance, Company or individual department/team performance, and market factors. Our application deadline is 40 days from the date of posting. In good faith, the posting may be removed prior to this date if the position is filled or extended in good faith.
