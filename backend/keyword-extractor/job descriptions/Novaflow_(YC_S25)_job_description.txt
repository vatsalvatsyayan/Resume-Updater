About the job

Job Title: Full Stack Engineer

Location: San Francisco

Type: Full-time




About Us:

Novaflow is bridging the gap between researchers and technology, creating tools in order to make analysis more accessible and efficient for everyday biologists. We are leveraging AI to allow biologists to analyze their own data in real time rather than outsource the work to other bioinformatics services. As an early stage company, we’ve already seen incredible excitement about us and the work we’re doing. We’re backed by some amazing investors including Y Combinator who believe in our bold vision to transform how scientific data analysis is done. 




The ideal candidate possesses strong technical skills, a bias for action, and a drive for making a large, measurable impact in an early-stage environment. This individual thrives in complex, fast-paced environments and plays a pivotal role in driving the mission of the company forward with passion, focus, and scale.




The position is based in San Francisco. Having biology knowledge and experience is not required but is nice to have.




What you'll do:

Build and ship user-facing features across the stack
Design and implement clean, reliable APIs for data processing and visualization
Develop dashboards, visualizations, and internal tools used by scientists and research teams
Make architectural decisions 
Improve performance and scalability of data-heavy workflows
Work closely with founders, users, and customers to shape product direction
Shape product direction, engineering culture, and hiring processes from the ground up

What we're looking for:

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent extensive experience
Have 2+ years of experience building production web applications
Comfortable with Python, TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL
Highly product-oriented and cares deeply about user experience
Thrives in ambiguous, high-agency environments and enjoys owning problems end-to-end

Bonus points:

Experience in biotech, healthcare, or other science-adjacent domains
Understanding of bioinformatics technologies
Background building data-heavy applications or visualization tools
Have prior startup experience or a strong desire to work close to the metal




This is the perfect opportunity for someone who wants to experience what it’s like to build a startup from the ground up. You’ll work directly with the founders, gain visibility into product strategy, customer conversations, and fundraising, and see what it takes to scale a fast-growing YC company. If you’re entrepreneurial and curious about being a founder one day, this role will give you the front-row seat to how world-class startups are built.

Creating tools to automate data analysis for life science researchers.

Bioinformatics and other types of data analysis will often take weeks or months, and can make many experiments prohibitively expensive, due to limited availability and high cost of bioinformaticians.

With Novaflow, you can process your data from raw files to publication-ready plots in hours or days, at a fraction of the cost.
