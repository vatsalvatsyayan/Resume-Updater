About the team and the role:

We are the eBay Cloud team, we power the foundational infrastructure that supports thousands of eBay applications. We operate and manage one of the industry's largest private cloud platforms based on open-source technology, which includes hundreds of Kubernetes clusters and millions of compute instances.
Our mission is to provide end-to-end governance and support for the full lifecycle of eBay applications running on our platform. We focus on building and improving the platform's cloud-native capabilities to ensure these applications are reliable, efficient, scalable and secure.
We are looking for an aspiring Cloud Platform Engineer to join the team. In this role, you will be a key contributor to the design, implementation, and management of the tools and systems that govern the application lifecycle on our private cloud.
You will help drive the adoption of cloud-native principles, focusing on improving developer efficiency through CI/CD automation and ensuring security compliance across our platform.




What you will accomplish:

Design and develop the core products and services that govern the full application lifecycle on our private cloud, focusing on building platform capabilities and cultivate an AI-first cloud architecture that seamlessly supports diverse application requirements rather than operating end-user applications in the cloud.
Drive the engineering efforts to continuously integrate and adapt the latest open-source technologies (e.g., Kubernetes) to construct a reliable, efficient, and scalable platform that meets our stringent security and operational standards.
Build robust, high-performance automation and diagnostic tools in languages like Go and Java to streamline platform operations and reduce the need for manual intervention.
Develop and deploy foundational observability frameworks, ensuring deep visibility into the platform's health for proactive issue resolution and continuous performance tuning.
Collaborate closely with internal platform teams to ensure the seamless validation, adoption, and integration of new eBay Cloud platform features.




What you will bring:

Currently enrolled as a student in an accredited Bachelors or Masters degree program within the United States graduating in Summer 2026. We will also consider candidates who have completed their degree as of December 2025.
0-3 years of relevant work experience
Experience in building cloud platforms is a plus. This may include coursework, academic projects, or relevant internships, with a strong interest in building cloud-native applications.
Proficient in programming with at least one language such as Java, Go, C++, or Python, and a willingness to learn others.
Foundational understanding or familiarity with containerization and orchestration technologies (e.g., Kubernetes), and concepts of scalable, reliable cloud lifecycle management systems.
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills with an eagerness to learn how to identify system-level gaps and multi-functional issues, propose effective solutions, and drive resolution.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
