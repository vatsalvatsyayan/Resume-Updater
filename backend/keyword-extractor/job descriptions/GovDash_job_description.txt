About the job

GovDash helps businesses win and deliver government contracts that advance American interests.

Our AI platform is a single, secure, workflow-driven system for the full contracting lifecycle, from opportunity discovery and capture through proposal execution, award, and post-award operations.

In 2025 alone, GovDash customers won more than $5B in government contracts. We’ve raised $42M to move faster on product and scale GovDash nationwide.

We are building the rails to do business with the government.

GovDash is an AI company helping businesses find, win, and manage government contracts. Our platform automates business development, capture, proposal, and contract workflows end-to-end. This helps contractors grow faster and better serve government missions.

Our small, talent-dense team includes engineers from Google, Lockheed Martin, and CACI, along with veteran proposal managers and capture leaders. This mix of AI talent and deep GovCon expertise uniquely positions us to redefine how contractors work.

In just 12 months, GovDash has scaled to millions in ARR and become the platform of choice for contractors nationwide. We are now building an AI-first ERP for government contractors and, ultimately, the most powerful procurement platform ever created. Join us.

About The Role

We're hiring a Software Engineer (Product) to help build GovDash's core product experiences. This role is for engineers who enjoy working across the stack, owning product features end-to-end, and shipping high-quality software that customers rely on every day.

You'll contribute to multiple product areas over time, building reusable systems, intuitive user interfaces, and reliable backend services that power mission‑critical workflows for government contractors. While teams may focus on different domains, this role is centered on full‑stack product development , customer impact, and strong engineering fundamentals.

Own projects end‑to‑end, from technical design through deployment, with a relentless focus on customer experience.
Build intuitive interfaces and APIs that help users understand, guide, and trust AI‑powered workflows.
Create systems that surface reasoning, highlight errors, emphasize citations, and track progress across complex documents.
Improve system reliability, performance, and scalability as the platform grows.
Continuously incorporate user feedback to refine features and deliver better customer outcomes.


What We're Looking For


Strong full‑stack development experience with TypeScript / Node.js.
Comfort working across frontend and backend systems (React‑based UIs and service APIs).
Strong CS fundamentals, sound architectural judgment, and experience scaling production systems.
Product‑oriented mindset and an obsession with customer experience and usability.
Self‑starter with an ownership mentality who thrives in a fast‑paced startup environment.
Clear communicator who collaborates effectively across disciplines.


Nice to Have


Previous experience as a founder or engineer at a fast-growing startup.
Experience building AI‑powered or LLM‑enabled product features.
Experience with government contracting or public‑sector software.
Experience with complex integrations and syncing with external systems.
