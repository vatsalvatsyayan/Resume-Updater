About The Role

Clearstory is looking for a Junior Fullstack Software Engineer to join our Integrations team, a foundational group that powers how our platform connects with the broader construction technology ecosystem. Integrations are critical to Clearstory's success, and in this role you'll help build the systems that allow customers, partners, and products to work together seamlessly.

This is a high-impact opportunity for an early-career engineer who's eager to learn, contribute across the stack, and grow within a collaborative, product-focused engineering team. You'll work closely with experienced engineers and product leaders to help shape a category-defining SaaS platform transforming how commercial construction teams manage change.

Clearstory is an AI-forward engineering organization. We actively encourage engineers to leverage modern AI tools to accelerate learning, improve code quality, and move faster while still holding a high bar for craftsmanship and customer impact.

We operate in a hybrid work model: 3 days per week in the office, with the option to work 2 days per week from home if desired. We value in-person collaboration while supporting flexibility.

As a junior engineer, you will:


 Build meaningful features across the stack, from UI components to backend services and integrations. 
 Work on integrations that are core to Clearstory's platform and customer experience. 
 Learn through hands-on mentorship, code reviews, and close collaboration with senior engineers. 
 Gain experience with modern development workflows and SDLC in a SOC 2-compliant environment. 
 Use AI-powered tools as part of your day-to-day development workflow to learn faster and deliver better outcomes. 



About You

We're looking for someone who:


 Is curious, proactive, and genuinely excited to learn. 
 Takes ownership, follows through, and asks thoughtful questions. 
 Communicates clearly and collaborates well across engineering and product. 
 Cares deeply about code quality, reliability, and delivering real customer value. 
 Thrives in a fast-paced, evolving startup environment. 
 Embodies our core values: Be Curious, Customer Obsession, and Keep It Simple. 


If you're excited to grow quickly, work on meaningful problems, and see your impact firsthand, you'll fit right in.
