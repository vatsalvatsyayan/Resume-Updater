About the job

Note: Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions will not be providing visa sponsorship for this position now or in the future. Therefore, in order to be considered for this position, you must have the ability to work in the United States without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.


Must be local to Raleigh/Durham, NC Area. This is a hybrid role at least 3 days a week in person. 


Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions is seeking an Associate Software Support Engineer whose primary responsibility is resolving software defects using AI-driven development and analysis tooling. This role is designed for new Computer Science graduates who bring a strong quality mindset and can demonstrate effective use of AI to diagnose, fix, and validate defects in production software.

This is not a traditional manual coding role. Code analysis, generation, and remediation are performed through AI-driven workflows, with the engineer responsible for correctness, validation, and quality outcomes.

What You’ll Do


Own software defects from intake through resolution using AI-driven tooling
Use AI to analyze root cause, generate fixes, and validate solutions
Verify fixes through testing and quality checks before closure
Ensure defect resolutions meet quality, stability, and regression standards
Clearly document defect causes, resolutions, and validation results


How You’ll Be Measured


Successful defect resolution rate
Fix quality (low defect re-open and regression rates)
Adherence to quality and validation standards


Required Qualifications


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or closely related field
Demonstrated proficiency using AI-driven tools to resolve software defects
Strong understanding of core software concepts (APIs, data flow, debugging fundamentals)
High attention to detail and a strong sense of software quality
Ability to follow structured processes and validate outcomes rigorously


Nice to Have


Exposure to testing frameworks or CI/CD pipelines
Experience with defect tracking systems
Academic or personal projects using AI-driven development workflows


Why This Role


Clear, outcome-based expectations focused on quality
Hands-on experience with AI-driven software resolution from day one


Strong foundation for growth into engineering, quality, or AI-centric development roles
