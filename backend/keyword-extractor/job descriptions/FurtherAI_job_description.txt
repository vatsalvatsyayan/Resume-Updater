Role Details

Location: San Francisco, CA. This role is based out of our San Francisco HQ and is not eligible for full-time remote work.

Compensation: The annual salary range for this position is $150,000 - $250,000 based on level in addition to equity & benefits

About Us

At FurtherAI, we’re building the next generation of AI agents for the insurance industry - a trillion-dollar market ready for transformation.

We’ve raised more than $30M from top investors (Andreesen Horowitz, YC, Nexus, South Park Commons, Converge) and have grown 10x in revenue this year alone. Our customers include some of the largest names in insurance (we recently closed a top 5 insurance company in the world), and our team combines deep AI expertise with proven company-building experience.

Now, we’re looking for an exceptional Software Engineer to join our early team and help shape both our product and culture.

Why Join Us


Rocketship Growth: Post-PMF, with revenue growing at an exceptional pace. 
Elite Team: Founding team includes ex-Apple AI Research, 4 ex-YC founders, and 6 ex-founders. Engineers have prior experience at Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. 
Technical Depth: Work alongside a staff research scientist and a team of 7 engineers solving cutting-edge problems in AI and scalable backend systems. 
Massive Market Impact: Insurance is the backbone of global commerce - our work reshapes how this industry operates. 
Founder’s Mindset: Perfect fit if you want to own big pieces of the product and possibly start your own company in the future. 


What You’ll Do


Build and scale the core product, ensuring performance, reliability, and continuous improvement. 
Own significant portions of the backend stack in Python. 
Collaborate directly with founders to set the technical direction. 
Operate with extreme ownership in a fast-paced, high-output environment. 
Work in-person from our San Francisco office (5 day week)


What We’re Looking For


2+ years building products. 
Strong experience with backend systems (Python preferred). 
Clear communicator - both in person and in writing. 
Bonus: background in B2B SaaS and 0 - 1 experience
Above all: drive, grit, and ownership. If you excel here, other requirements are secondary


At FurtherAI, we set a high bar. We’re not looking for someone who just wants a job—we’re looking for someone who wants to build something transformative. If you thrive in environments where the pace is fast, expectations are high, and the rewards are outsized, you’ll love it here.

Compensation Range: $150K - $250K
