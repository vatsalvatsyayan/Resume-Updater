About the job

HockeyStack Is An Applied AI Company On a Mission To Automate Sales, Marketing, And Customer Success For B2B Companies. We Build The Most Complete And Accurate Picture Of The B2B Buyer By Integrating With Every Tool Your Team Uses, Partnering With Third-party Data Providers, And Deploying Custom AI Research Agents. We Use This Data To Power Applications That Automate High-value, High-complexity Workflows Across The Go-to-market And Revenue Teams. Our Core Products Include


Marketing Intelligence – instantly answers questions like “What led to that sudden drop in pipeline?”
Account Intelligence – surfaces next-best actions to help reps move target accounts toward conversion


Since launching in January 2023, we’ve come through Y Combinator, raised a $26M Series A led by Bessemer. We’re growing 3× year-over-year, have hit multimillion ARR, and process over 60 TB of GTM data monthly. Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

As a Backend Engineer on the Reporting team, your mission is to turn massive volumes of GTM data into fast, reliable, and accurate reporting infrastructure that our customers depend on every single day. You’ll be the engine behind our most critical dashboards, insights, and customer-facing queries — owning the logic, performance, and scalability of the systems that translate raw data into strategic action. This is where your obsession with performance, precision, and product impact turns into rocket fuel for our growth.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Own and continuously improve the backend systems that power all reporting features across the platform
Design, write, and maintain high-performance SQL queries — including some that span 500+ lines — to deliver critical GTM insights
Develop and maintain backend services in Node.js and Express that transform raw data into actionable output
Improve query performance across massive datasets stored in ClickHouse and other systems
Work cross-functionally with Product and Frontend teams to deliver accurate, real-time dashboards and insights
Implement robust caching strategies, edge-case handling, and reliability measures at scale
Ship fast and often — deploying to production frequently while maintaining high-quality standards


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Fully committed to working in-person 5 days/week at our SF HQ
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Strong backend engineering experience with Node.js and modern JavaScript/TypeScript
Proficiency in writing and optimizing complex SQL queries
Experience working with analytical databases like ClickHouse
Familiarity with data infrastructure, reporting systems, or analytics-heavy SaaS products
Exposure to B2B GTM data, real-time dashboards, or BI tools


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

As part of our San Francisco, California-based team, the salary range for this role is $160,000– $200,000 USD base pay annually, depending on experience and qualifications.

HockeyStack is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status. We celebrate diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all employees.
