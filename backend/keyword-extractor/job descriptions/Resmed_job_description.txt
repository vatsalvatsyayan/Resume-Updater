About the job

We’re looking for an Associate AWS Developer to join our engineering team in delivering cutting-edge digital health experiences that scale globally. You’ll contribute to full-stack solutions using modern technologies in a collaborative, agile environment, helping build applications that directly improve the lives of patients and healthcare providers.

You’re a curious problem-solver who’s early in your career and eager to learn. You bring enthusiasm, ownership, and foundational technical skills, and you’re excited to grow alongside a team of passionate engineers committed to innovation and excellence.

What You’ll Do:



Implement and maintain features in software applications that are reliable, scalable, and secure, with guidance from more senior engineers.
Collaborate with engineers, product managers, designers, and architects to help define and implement solutions that meet user and business needs.
Contribute to system design discussions and learn how to make technical decisions in cloud-based, serverless environments.
Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code, following team standards and best practices.
Participate in code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing to both learn and contribute.
Help investigate, troubleshoot, and fix software defects and basic performance issues.
Support the continuous improvement of development processes and delivery pipelines by giving feedback and trying new tools and practices.



What You Bring:



0–2 years of professional software development experience (internships, projects, or relevant coursework welcome).
Experience with Python and a basic understanding of object-oriented design and clean code principles.
Some exposure to AWS services (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3) and an interest in deepening your cloud and serverless skills.
Interest in or familiarity with infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK).
Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and web application concepts; familiarity with authentication/authorization (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) is a plus.
Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) is a plus, but not required.
Basic knowledge of databases (either relational or NoSQL) and comfort learning new data technologies.
Exposure to or interest in DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines, Git, Docker, and monitoring/logging tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog).
Understanding of fundamental software testing concepts (e.g., unit and integration tests); exposure to end-to-end testing tools (e.g., Cypress) is a plus.
Comfortable working in agile development environments and using collaboration tools like Jira, Confluence, and GitHub (or similar).
A collaborative mindset, strong communication skills, and eagerness to learn, ask questions, and grow with mentorship.
A degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience (bootcamps, self-taught, or projects).



Joining us is more than saying “yes” to making the world a healthier place. It’s discovering a career that’s challenging, supportive and inspiring. Where a culture driven by excellence helps you not only meet your goals, but also create new ones. We focus on creating a diverse and inclusive culture, encouraging individual expression in the workplace and thrive on the innovative ideas this generates. If this sounds like the workplace for you, apply now! We commit to respond to every applicant.

Commitments

Work-life balance

At Resmed we know the importance of work/life balance and believe in supporting our people and families with flexible working arrangements that prioritize wellbeing and belonging, while driving growth and innovation.

We understand that working flexibly means different things to different people and keep this front of mind when it comes to talking about how, when and where our team work most effectively together to ensure our people and business thrive.

We encourage open dialogue around requests for flexibility as it can take many forms and we also recognise that certain flexibility arrangements will not always work for all roles given the different scope of our operational needs.

What we do know is that a flexible approach builds a greater level of trust, empowerment and feeling valued. In our experience it leads to better engagement, increased commitment and higher performance and productivity. We also know that it enables a better balance and quality of life. That is why, at ResMed, flexibility is core to our approach and charter. We have a passion and enthusiasm for enabling the use of flexible work arrangements so our team can work appropriately and where they work best.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion

At Resmed, our commitment to fostering belonging is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. Everything we do is influenced by our desire for all team members to feel heard, valued and accepted – to feel included. This informs all of our interactions, communications, hiring practices, policies and decisions. We work hard to create a safe and inclusive environment that values diversity.
… more

Environmental sustainability

At Resmed we are always striving to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our business operations and supply chain. We are committed to working with our employees, suppliers and customers to:
 - Eliminate unnecessary waste in all our systems & processes.
- Minimize our pollution, especially our non-biodegradable waste to landfill process
- Design and develop products with reduced impact on the environment throughout their lifecycle
- Increasing our employees' awareness of the environmental impacts of their decisions and actions
- Monitor our environmental performance and collaborate with employees, suppliers, customers, and regulatory bodies to make continual improvements
