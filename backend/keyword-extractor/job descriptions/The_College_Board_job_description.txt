About Technology At College Board

We are a mission-driven engineering team building and evolving the technology that powers and protects the future of learning. Our systems support highly trusted education programs used by millions of students each year, operating at significant scale and public responsibility. Today, we are focused on designing and delivering a critical new initiative that extends our platform in meaningful ways: blending foundational system work with thoughtful experimentation as we adapt to emerging technologies and new learner needs. We combine modern, cloud-native engineering practices with years of platform modernization, security hardening, and large-scale digital delivery, operating as an experiment factory that tests assumptions and iterates based on evidence rather than tradition. What makes this team distinct is the rare combination of meaningful public impact, platform-scale technical challenges, and the freedom to shape how mission-critical systems are built and evolved.

About The Team

The Core Assessment Platform is a group of cross-functional teams responsible for building and evolving shared platform capabilities that support assessment-related systems used by institutions at scale. The work spans a range of assessment contexts, from routine evaluation to more complex, high-stakes environments, where accuracy, consistency, and trust are essential. Teams collaborate across engineering, product, design, data, and operations to build reliable capabilities that can be reused and adapted over time. What makes this group special is its focus on continuous learning, experimentation, and steady improvement, with success driven by thoughtful collaboration, iteration, and careful decision-making in environments where reliability and quality matter.



About The Opportunity  

In this role, you’ll contribute to production systems used at significant scale while learning how large, secure platforms are designed, built, and evolved responsibly. You’ll work alongside experienced engineers to ship code, test ideas, and improve shared capabilities that support assessment-related systems used by institutions. The focus is on learning by doing, while gaining exposure to real-world engineering challenges while building a strong foundation in modern development practices. This role emphasizes growth, feedback, and continuous learning. You’ll be encouraged to ask questions, experiment thoughtfully, and develop an understanding of system, not just features, while contributing meaningful work in an environment where reliability and quality matter.
