About the job

Who Are We?

Have you struggled to reserve that coveted summer camping spot at a state park? Wondered why you’re still filling out a paper form at the DMV? Or tried (and failed) to book your favorite pickleball court from your phone?

Kaizen Labs is rebuilding the government’s digital front door - bringing modern, people-first software to the public services millions of Americans rely on every day. From parks & recreation and permitting to licensing and payments, we’re replacing outdated systems with intuitive, beautiful technology designed for residents and the public servants who serve them.

Our platform now powers over 50 agencies across 17 states, reaching more than 40 million residents. Recent partners include Maricopa County (AZ), San Bernardino County (CA), and the Cherokee Nation. In Maryland, our platform helped eliminate seven-mile traffic jams at state parks, saving hundreds of thousands in costs and dramatically improving the visitor experience.

Founded in 2022 and based in New York City, Kaizen has raised $35 million from world-class investors, including NEA, Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, 776, and Carpenter Capital.

We’re a team of builders, designers, and operators redefining what it means to serve the public in the digital age - and we’re just getting started.




Location

This is a hybrid role based out of our New York City HQ. Candidates must reside in New York or be able to commute to New York City to work out of our office at least three times a week (Tuesdays - Thursdays).




The Role

We’re looking for our first Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) to work directly with our customers, understand their requests, and build solutions that deliver immediate impact. FDSEs sit at the intersection of engineering and deployment. You will partner closely with external customers to translate real-world workflows into polished, scalable software. You’ll also help our engineering team build expertise in rapid iteration, pattern recognition, and utilizing AI tooling to accelerate development. This role is ideal for an engineer who loves building fast for real users, thrives in ambiguous contexts, and is energized by operating at the edge of customer needs.




What You’ll Do

Build end-to-end solutions: Design and implement full-stack features (React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node, Postgres) driven by customer needs
Turn ambiguity into clarity: Scope unclear customer problems and translate them into buildable engineering work
Prototype and iterate rapidly: Gather feedback directly from users and incorporate it into tight iteration cycles
Use AI to accelerate workflows: Leverage AI copilots and automation to code faster, debug smarter, and synthesize user patterns
Drive cross-functional alignment: Collaborate with product, design, engineering, and deployment to unblock issues and move work forward
Contribute to scalable systems: Identify recurring customer needs and build reusable components, playbooks, or internal tools




Who You Are

A product-minded engineer who cares deeply about user experience, clarity, and outcomes
You are AI-native and excited to push a new generation of development and product tools to their limit
Comfortable working directly with customers and guiding them through technical decisions
Energized by ambiguous, fast-moving problem spaces and capable of bringing structure to them
Equally comfortable thinking in systems and diving into implementation details
Collaborative, low-ego, and motivated by mission-driven work




What You’ll Bring

3+ years of professional software engineering experience
Experience building full-stack applications with modern web technologies (React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres)
Ability to translate customer workflows and pain points into technical solutions
Strong communication skills with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Comfort supporting deployments, integrations, or customer-facing technical work
A bias toward action, learning, and continuous iteration
Excitement about using AI tools to improve engineering speed, quality, and reliability




Strong Candidates May Also…

Have experience in civic tech, public sector deployments, consulting, or forward-deployed engineering
Have built AI-enhanced workflows or used AI agents extensively for development
Have led customer-facing implementations or integrations in complex environments
Have contributed to internal documentation, tooling, or cultural practices that improve team velocity
