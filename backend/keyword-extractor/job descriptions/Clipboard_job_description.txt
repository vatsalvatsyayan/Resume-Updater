Your Mission: Innovate, Execute, and Deliver Impact

As a Software Engineer at Clipboard Health, you won’t just write code—you’ll craft solutions that reshape how healthcare professionals and facilities connect. You’ll collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to build features that matter. If you love diving deep into technical challenges and emerging with high-impact solutions, this is your opportunity to make a real difference. Because we’re growing quickly, this is an evergreen role—we’re continually looking to add talented software engineers to our team.

What You’ll Do: Own the Code, Shape the Future


Deliver High-Quality, Scalable Code
Write performant backend services using Node/NestJS and reliable frontend experiences with React and TypeScript.
Leverage MongoDB, Postgres, and Redis to ensure data integrity and speed at scale.
Develop Reusable Components and Utilities
Contribute clean, modular code for our web and mobile applications (Ionic/React, Dart/Flutter).
Work closely with the DevX team to enhance tooling and libraries that bolster productivity across our global engineering org.
Own the Full Software Development Lifecycle
From problem definition and design through to development, testing, demoing, and supporting production code.
Deploy your own code using trunk-based development and short-lived feature branches with automated regression testing.
Collaborate with Product Managers and Customers
Understand the real-world problems faced by our facility clients, nurses, and internal users.
Occasionally engage directly with customers to gather feedback, confirm requirements, and ensure solutions truly solve their problems.
Embrace a Remote-First Culture
Communicate effectively in a globally distributed team—embrace asynchronous discussions, thorough documentation, and over-communication when needed.
Participate in daily overlap sessions or syncs, typically in the mornings (US PST), to stay aligned with your team.
Contribute to a Customer-Centric Approach
Whether fixing bugs, tackling tech debt (about 20% of our time), or brainstorming new features, always keep the user’s experience front and center.
Balance speedy fixes for pressing customer issues with longer-term structural improvements.
Participate in On-Call Rotations
Own the systems you build: if something breaks, you’re part of the solution.
Typically on-call for one week out of the month, ensuring our platform remains reliable around the clock.

What You Bring to the Table: A High-Ownership Mindset


Professional Software Development
Proficiency in building complex web or mobile apps, ideally with TypeScript, React, and Node/NestJS (but a specific language background is not required)
Experience developing, monitoring, and supporting services in production.
Deep Technical Expertise
Strong understanding of service-specific integration testing, E2E testing, and selective unit tests.
Familiarity with AWS (ECS, Terraform) and best practices for deploying cloud-based applications.
Problem-Solving Chops
You thrive in “low-structure, high-ownership” environments, diving deep into complex issues and surfacing clear, elegant solutions.
Comfortable balancing immediate customer needs with robust long-term architecture planning.
Excellent Communication
Clear writing is essential for our remote culture—you know how to articulate ideas, provide concise PR feedback, and document decisions thoroughly.
Open to giving and receiving frequent feedback, even when it’s uncomfortable, to drive continuous improvement.
Customer Empathy
Driven by a desire to make real-world impacts. You love collaborating with PMs and occasionally customers, ensuring that features resonate with end-users’ needs.
