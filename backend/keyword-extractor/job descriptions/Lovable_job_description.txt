Why Lovable?

Lovable lets anyone and everyone build software with any language. From solopreneurs to Fortune 100 teams, millions of people use Lovable to transform raw ideas into real products - fast.

We are at the forefront of a foundational shift in software creation, which means you have an unprecedented opportunity to change the way the digital world works. Over 2 million people in 200+ countries already use Lovable to launch businesses, automate work, and bring their ideas to life. And we’re just getting started.

We’re a small, talent-dense team building a generation-defining company from Stockholm. We value extreme ownership, high velocity and low-ego collaboration. We seek out people who care deeply, ship fast, and are eager to make a dent in the world.

Technical Evangelist

Location: SF, Stockholm

The Role

We’re looking for a Technical Evangelist who lives at the intersection of code, community, and creativity. You’ll be one of the most public faces of Lovable — building with the product, showing what’s possible, and helping developers fall in love with it.

This is not a “marketing engineer” role. You will ship real things, write real code, and teach by example.

What You’ll Do


Build compelling demos, prototypes, and real-world projects using Lovable
Create technical content: videos, social posts, tutorials, sample apps, and talks
Engage directly with builders via Discord, GitHub, Twitter/X, events, and meetups
Speak at conferences, hackathons, and community events (IRL & online)
Partner with Product & Engineering to influence roadmap based on user feedback
Help shape the voice, tone, and technical narrative of Lovable
Be a trusted technical guide for everyone from tire-kickers to power users


What We’re Looking For


Strong hands-on engineering background (frontend, backend, or full-stack)
Comfort building demos quickly and explaining why things work, not just how
Excellent technical communication skills — writing, speaking, and teaching
Deep empathy for developers and how they actually build
Curiosity, creativity, and a bias toward shipping
Experience with dev tools, platforms, or APIs


Bonus Points


Open source contributions or personal projects people actually use
Prior experience as an engineer or DevRel
Experience speaking at conferences or running workshops
Strong presence in developer communities


About Your Application


Please submit your application in English - it’s our company language so you’ll be speaking lots of it if you join
We treat all candidates equally - if you’re interested please apply through our careers portal
