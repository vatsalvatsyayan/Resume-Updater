About the job

What is movi?

We’re still here, can you believe it? What started in 2017 as a way for the skilled nursing market to order transportation has expanded to health systems, PACE, internal fleets and more. Our platform has evolved into so much more and is scaling rapidly. It’s been eight years and we are still a small team with the need to expand by two or three.







The current positions we are looking to fill are

ALL THINGS AI!!
Prompt Engineers
Engineer Prompters
AI and LLM Pontificators
Software Engineers
*Boopski Boops
Beep-to-the-bops




To be eligible for this role, you must be authorized to work in the United States without requiring employer sponsorship. We’d really like to find a local hire in Charleston 🌴 🏖️ but the right hire, particularly a west coaster, would certainly be considered.




Desired Experience

Typescript
Node.js
Angular
Nx builds and monorepos
MongoDB (or other NoSQL)Relational databases
RESTful API design and development
Jest, Cypress, TDD
Storybook
ECS, SQS, S3, Docker, Linux/UNIX, CI/CD Tools exposure
Excellent problem solving, creative thinking and self-motivation skills
Communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people
Associates or B.S Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology or equivalent required…or you didn’t waste money on school but have a lot of real world experience.




What helps you STAND OUT

You can make us laugh
🐝 your own keeper. Take the baton and run with it, but also know when to ask for help and don’t end up in a 🐇 hole
No smiles, all business
Attention to detail
Understanding sarcasm
Previous healthcare and HIPAA experience
You like database queries…even Mongo aggregates 😜
Archiving & Reporting
Nuanced experience in;
 Route Optimization/Transportation
 Medical system integration
 Insurance/Medical billing
 FHIR and SMART on FHIR
No matter where/how you apply you must send us an email to jobs+dev@movihealthcare.com with a subject that contains your preference between the word “beep” or “boop”




Life at Mōvī:

Generous Vacation
100% employer paid Medical, Dental, Vision. Like really 100% not just employee.
401K
Flexible Hours
Charleston SC – beaches, great restaurants and friendly city
Office on Upper King in the Industrious co-working space
Post startup with the growth and feel of a startup
We pay well…let’s discuss what it’ll take to get you to come aboard! ⛵




Day 1 Goal:

You make your first code commit
After that, you’re off to the races 🏇

* We are only hiring software engineers…the AI stuff was a joke. Yes, there is a place for it but it’s not the end all be all and we take patient privacy very seriously. With great power comes great responsibility and slapping AI on a healthcare product to increase your multiple is not what we are about. We need SEs that know how to use AI efficiently, safely, wisely and all the otherlys. If the right Beep-to-the-bop comes along we may consider that hire but are really looking for SEs.
