About Scoopz

Scoopz is a fast-growing consumer startup building the next evolution of short-form video. We’re engineers, product thinkers, and builders at heart, obsessed with shipping fast and learning faster. Our product goes beyond endless scrolling — we’re creating interest-based video communities where real people actually connect.

If you like solving hard problems at scale, moving with startup speed, and working with a team that values ownership, curiosity, and impact over titles, you’ll feel right at home here.

About The Role

We are looking for a passionate Full Stack / Backend Engineer to join our team. You will help build and scale the infrastructure that powers Scoopz’s video communities, ensuring fast, reliable, and seamless experiences for millions of users. You’ll collaborate closely with product, design, and other engineers to deliver features end-to-end — from database design and APIs to front-end interactions.

Responsibilities

Full Stack Engineer will be required to see out a project from conception to final product, requiring good organizational skills and attention to detail.


Design, build, and maintain scalable backend services (Java / Go / Python).
Develop responsive, performant web applications using modern frameworks (React, Next.js, or similar).
Collaborate with product managers, designers, and other engineers to deliver high-quality features end to end.
Implement robust API integrations and efficient data processing pipelines.
Participate in architecture reviews, code reviews, and continuous deployment cycles.
Continuously improve performance, scalability, and reliability of existing systems.


Requirements


Proficiency in at least one backend language (Java, Go, or Python).
Solid experience with modern frontend technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, or Next.js).
Strong understanding of RESTful APIs, database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB), and caching (Redis).
Familiarity with Git, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
Excellent problem-solving and communication skills.


Nice to Have


Experience with distributed systems, microservices, or cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
Knowledge of AI/ML, data processing, or automation pipelines.
Exposure to high-traffic production environments and performance tuning.
