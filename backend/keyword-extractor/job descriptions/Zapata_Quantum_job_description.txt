Company Description

Zapata Quantum is shaping the future of quantum computing: setting the standards for what’s viable, valuable, and worth building. The Company powers quantum applications across cryptography, pharmaceuticals, finance, materials discovery, defense, and beyond, translating cutting-edge research into real-world impact.




Zapata is the only organization to have contributed across every technical area of DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking program, giving it a uniquely comprehensive view of what it takes to make quantum computing work in practice. Now restructured and sharply focused, Zapata Quantum stands alone as the only publicly traded, pure-play quantum software company fully dedicated to unlocking quantum’s commercial potential.




We’re rebuilding at a pivotal moment for the industry—bringing together a team that will help define how quantum delivers value in the real world, with the opportunity for meaningful ownership as we shape the commercial path forward.




Role Description

We are seeking a skilled Full-Stack Engineer to design and develop a user-interactive web application supporting a knowledge graph related to quantum computing. The role focuses on building intuitive user interfaces, translating complex data structures into accessible experiences, and integrating AI-enabled application features. Prior experience in quantum computing is not required.

This position offers a high level of individual ownership and is well suited to engineers who are comfortable working independently within a small, focused team. Collaboration will be lightweight, with structured check-ins occurring approximately once per week.




Qualifications

Strong full-stack engineering fundamentals
Demonstrated experience building user-facing web applications
Solid understanding of UI/UX principles and product usability
Familiarity with AI-enabled application workflows or integrations
Ability to work independently and manage deliverables with minimal oversight
Willingness to learn new technical domains as needed




Key Responsibilities

Design, implement, and maintain a modern, user-interactive web application
Develop clean, intuitive UI/UX for navigating complex technical content
Integrate AI-driven features such as intelligent search, recommendations, or contextual assistance
Make architectural and product decisions in collaboration with a small leadership team
Deliver high-quality software with minimal supervision




Desired Programming Skills

React — building responsive, high-quality user interfaces
TypeScript / JavaScript
API Design (REST)
Cypher (Neo4j)
Vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS)  
Python
LaTeX




Preferred Experience

Experience with data-intensive, graph-based, or visualization-heavy applications
Evidence of shipped products, professional work, or substantial personal projects
Strong communication skills and comfort articulating technical and design decisions
