About the job

About Flamingo

Flamingo is an award-winning body, hair, and care brand delivering high-performance, thoughtfully designed products at an accessible price. Since launching in 2018, we’ve become the #3 player in women’s shave in the U.S. and expanded our assortment to offer products for every routine: razors, wax steps for face and body, shave gel, and body lotion. Our products and campaigns have been covered by Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle, and InStyle, and we’ve won major beauty accolades from Allure and Essence. With a mission to empower women, Flamingo is committed to partnering with nonprofit partners working to help women and girls build healthy relationships with their bodies and has helped connect over 200K people to quality mental health and wellbeing resources.

Flamingo is part of Mammoth Brands, the modern CPG company behind category-leading brands Harry’s, Flamingo, Lume, Mando, and Coterie. Driven by a mission to “Create Things People Like More,” the company is creating a new model—and home—for brands, founders, and talent looking to solve unmet needs, improve peoples’ lives and ultimately change the status quo. Even as we grow, we take extra care to maintain the small, scrappy, entrepreneurial culture that helped to get us where we are today: a company that people like more, that better serves its customers, employees, and community. Mammoth Brands is committed to making a positive impact and donated over $20 million through our network of nonprofit partners to date.

About The Team

We're the H&F DTC Engineering team, and we're here to make personal care effortless for customers around the world. We build and maintain the digital shopping experiences that bring new customers into the Harry's and Flamingo family and keep our loyal customers coming back. Our stack is modern (JavaScript/TypeScript, Remix, Hydrogen, Oxygen) and our approach is thoughtful—we prioritize speed, reliability, and simplicity. We're a tight-knit crew of engineers who care deeply about craft, collaboration, and continuous learning.

About The Role

We're looking for a Software Engineer to join our team and grow with us. You'll work alongside experienced engineers who are excited to mentor and collaborate, shipping real features from your first weeks. This is an opportunity to build your engineering fundamentals while working on a platform that serves millions of customers. We value curiosity, ownership, and a willingness to learn—and we're especially excited about engineers who bring fresh perspectives and embrace modern tools (including AI) in their workflow.

What You Will Accomplish


Ship production code within your first weeks, starting with bug fixes and progressing to well-scoped features
Build and improve customer-facing features that directly impact how people discover, evaluate, and purchase our products
Own features end-to-end: from ticket to code to review to deploy to monitor
Work with integrations that power the shopping experience—payments, analytics, marketing tools, and fulfillment systems
Contribute to sprint work and participate actively in team ceremonies
Engage meaningfully in code reviews—both giving and receiving feedback
Bring your toolkit and teach us something new—whether that's an AI workflow, a debugging technique, or a fresh approach to a problem


This should describe you


Strong JavaScript/TypeScript fundamentals and familiarity with React or similar component-based frameworks
Genuinely curious—you actively seek out learning opportunities and stay up to date on new developments in your field
Curious about how e-commerce works—you're interested in why conversion rates, page speed, and checkout flows matter, not just how to build them
Comfortable using AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in your development workflow—and you know how to validate their output
Take ownership of your work: you dive in without being asked twice and deliver on your commitments
Open to feedback and eager to give it—you believe code reviews make everyone better
Keep your cool when plans change and recommit with positivity


Nice to have


Experience with Shopify, Remix, Hydrogen, or e-commerce platforms
Familiarity with AWS or cloud platforms
Awareness of web performance optimization and its impact on user experience


Here's Who You'll Work With


Reporting to Director of Engineering
Working on the H&F DTC Engineering team alongside Staff and Senior Staff Engineers
Collaborating cross-functionally with Product Management and Design


Benefits And Perks

The Mammoth Brands working model is in-office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Our beautiful 70,000 square foot SoHo office is decked out with bagels on Wednesdays and lunch on Thursdays, and fully stocked kitchens with snacks, coffee, and drinks everyday. Can’t forget the free products and the opportunity to have some meetings without Zoom!

We can’t quantify all of the intangible things we think you’ll love about working at Mammoth Brands, like the exciting challenges we tackle, the smart and humble team you’ll get to work with, and our supportive and inclusive culture. That said, our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of our total rewards package, which also includes a comprehensive set of benefits and our equity program. The base salary hiring range for this position is $110,000-$130,000, but the final compensation offer will ultimately be based on the candidate’s location, skill level and experience.

Mammoth Brands is committed to bringing together individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive, feel a sense of belonging, and do great work together.

Mammoth Brands is an Equal Opportunity Employer, providing equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals.
