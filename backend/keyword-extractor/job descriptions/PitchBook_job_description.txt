Working Conditions

At the heart of our company is a belief in the power of in-person collaboration. Being together in the office fuels our creativity, strengthens our connections, and drives the innovation that sets us apart. Our culture is built on spontaneous moments—those hallway conversations, whiteboard brainstorms, and shared celebrations in each of our global offices—that simply can’t be replicated remotely. This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

The job conditions for this position are in a standard office setting. Employees in this position use PC and phone on an on-going basis throughout the day. Limited corporate travel may be required to remote offices or other business meetings and events.

Life At PB

We are consistently recognized as a Best Place to Work and our culture is at the heart of our success. It’s our fundamental belief that people do and create great things and that people are the cornerstone of prosperity. We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we’ve heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.

We are excited to get to know you and your background. Concerned that you might not meet every requirement? We encourage you to still apply as you might be the right candidate for the role or other roles at PitchBook.
