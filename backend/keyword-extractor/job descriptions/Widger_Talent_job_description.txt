About the job

﻿Senior Software Engineer (TypeScript)

Austere Moose | Full-Time | Los Angeles (Brentwood)

Widger Talent is assisting with this search




About Austere Moose

Austere Moose is a hands-on venture studio founded by Doug Hirsch and Trevor Bezdek.




After building GoodRx from zero to tens of millions of users, a public company, and billions in consumer savings, Doug and Trevor are back in true zero-to-one mode — building and launching new companies from scratch with a very small, senior team.




What We’re Building

Austere Moose is currently working with companies actively building products such as:

A healthcare AI platform that serves as the AI layer for every healthcare visit — recording conversations, summarizing them, and turning them into structured, actionable outputs for clinicians and systems downstream.
A consumer device focused on cosmetic skincare.




Our core applications are mobile-first, supported by substantial server-side systems, data pipelines, and AI infrastructure.




The Role

We’re looking for a high-agency, hands-on software engineer who wants to ship real product fast and own it end-to-end — frontend, backend, and infrastructure.




What You’ll Do

Write production code daily across mobile, backend, and APIs
Build and own systems end-to-end, including deployment and reliability
Work heavily in TypeScript across frontend and backend
Ship and scale AI-powered features (including LLM-driven workflows)
Make pragmatic architectural decisions that balance speed with long-term sanity
Partner closely with founders and early technical leaders in a small, fast-moving team




Who You Are

5–8+ years of experience shipping production software at a strong tech company or early-stage startup
Comfortable moving across mobile apps, backend services, and cloud infrastructure
Strong in TypeScript; experience with React / React Native, Node, and modern APIs
Have shipped AI- or data-intensive features into real user workflows
High-agency generalist — you take ownership and don’t wait for perfect requirements
Entrepreneurial mindset — founder, early employee, or serious side-project builder
Interested in healthcare and its real-world constraints (deep domain experience not required, but motivation matters)
Low ego, high judgment, and comfortable working without layers or bureaucracy




The Austere Moose Environment

Small, senior team with direct founder access
Quiet intensity, high trust, and zero unnecessary process
Short meetings, fast prototypes, real decisions
High standards, but humane — we value family time and kindness




Compensation & Benefits

Base salary: $140,000–$180,000 (depending on experience)
Meaningful equity in the businesses you help build
Benefits: Medical, dental, vision, 401(k)
Schedule: In-office core days (Brentwood), flexibility outside of that




How to Apply

Send us:

A brief note on something you shipped end-to-end (what you built, what broke, what you learned)
A link to a repo, demo, or technical write-up
Your résumé or LinkedIn profile

We review every application personally.




Austere Moose is an equal-opportunity employer.
