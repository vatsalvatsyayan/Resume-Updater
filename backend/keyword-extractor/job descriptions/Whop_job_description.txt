About the job

About Whop

Our mission is to deliver everyone a sustainable income. We've paid out over $2B to online business owners and we're growing fast. Our engineering team is small, but we are running some of the most critical payment rails on the internet. We ship fast and own what we build.

About The Role

You'll build systems where the stakes are real. Our checkout handles billions in transactions. Businesses depend on us to get paid. That means capturing payments, verifying identity, managing balances, and transferring money needs to be fast and secure. Users trust us with their income and we take that seriously.

What You'll Do


Improve conversion on our checkout page that handles billions in global transaction volume
Create embeddable SDK payments components to power the next generation of marketplaces
Add more payment methods and providers to optimize auth rates and global payments reach
Write world-class developer docs and interactive playgrounds for developers using our SDKs and components
Build clean interfaces and APIs for easy KYC, balance management, and withdraws
Experiment with ways to make payments easier and more accessible


You'll thrive here if you


Have a designer's eye. You notice when spacing is off, when animations feel janky, when flows could be simpler
Understand that payments UI is a trust exercise
Have built SDK components that lived inside other people's products
Comfortable with financial systems and know how money moves
Ship fast without sacrificing quality


Why now

The checkout experience that has processed $2B needs to handle 100x the volume, while converting even better.

You'll own surfaces millions of people interact with. Buyers completing purchases, creators checking balances, developers integrating our components. The craft you bring directly impacts whether Whop becomes the default way the internet does business.

If you've been looking for a high-stakes role where your taste in UI and systems thinking has real business impact, this is it.
