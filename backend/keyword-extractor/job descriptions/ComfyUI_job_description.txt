About the job

The Role

You will be a core contributor to open source ComfyUI, one of the most popular open source projects of our time.

Your mission is to create a world-class creative tool and workflow engine. You will architect, and implement the foundations that power our engineering organization — clean software abstractions, extensible RESTFUL APIs and Python SDK, and clean code. Decisions here have long-lasting implications, and can result in massive headwinds or tailwinds for the project, thus requiring exceptional attention to detail and thoughtful design.

Example projects include…


Writing shared abstractions that are extensible for future changes, such as the concept of subgraphs (within a graph)
Designing data models that can be evolved in an open source environment
Introducing a new core type, such as VIDEO or 3D
Partnering with product design and frontend engineers to ship user facing features that also need to work in headless environments (many users run ComfyUI as an API service). 


You might be a fit if…


Experience writing Python and maintaining APIs and SDKs used at scale
Regularly write and review code, maintaining a high bar for each
Care deeply about elegant software design and writing clean code
Bonus: Familiar with ComfyUI or other node based workflow tools
Bonus: Strong understanding of tensors, pytorch, and can contribute to implementing new models for ComfyUI


What is ComfyUI?

ComfyUI is the world’s leading visual AI platform — an open, modular system where anyone can build, customize, and automate AI workflows with precision and full control.

Unlike most AI tools that hide their inner workings behind a simple prompt box, ComfyUI gives professionals the freedom to design their own pipelines — connecting models, tools, and logic visually like building blocks.

It’s used by artists, filmmakers, video game creators, designers, researchers, VFX houses, and among others, teams at OpenAI, Netflix, Amazon Studios, Ubisoft, EA, and Tencent — all who want to go beyond presets and truly shape how AI creates.

ComfyUI empowers those who were not trained with the power of the brush to also be a painter, and those who are, to be a maestro.


Built for users who value transparency and control Infinitely extensible — thousands of community-made nodes and integrations
Scales from creative experimentation to production automation
Open-source, used by millions, and backed by one of the most active AI communities online
Evolving to democratize visual AI creation: empowering everyone from hobbyists to studios, storytellers, and enterprises to be more productive and creative than ever before


ComfyUI isn’t just another AI app. It’s aiming to become the operating system for visual generative AI , the foundation on which the next generation of creative tools are being built.

About Us

We are a small, intense, and well-funded team in San Francisco who push ComfyUI and its ecosystem forward. Our team comes from Stability AI and Google and many contributed to the ComfyUI ecosystem way before working here.

Our organization is flat and there is no hierarchy, only categories: dev, arts, prod, ops, etc (and no, there is no one here with the title of Member of Technical Staff, it’s long and silly for a job title).

The only thing that matters is the quality of your cultural fit and execution. We work hard and demand a lot of each other. But we have fun: everyone is here to make something meaningful that will end up being our life’s work. If this mission excites you and you view yourself as a top-tier talent, your future latent self is waiting for you at Comfy.

Check out our Github and blog for what we’ve been working on. Our investors include Pace Capital, Chemistry, Abstract Venture, and Guillermo Rauch.
