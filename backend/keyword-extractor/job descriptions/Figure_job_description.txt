About Figure

Figure (NASDAQ: FIGR) is transforming capital markets through blockchain. We’re proving that blockchain isn’t just theory - it’s powering real products used by hundreds of thousands of consumers and institutions.

By combining blockchain’s transparency and efficiency with AI-driven automation, we’ve reimagined how loans are originated, funded, and traded in secondary markets. From faster processing times to lower costs and reduced bias, our technology is helping borrowers, investors, and financial institutions achieve better outcomes.

Together with our 170+ partners, we’ve originated over $17 billion in home equity loans (HELOCs) on our blockchain-native platform, making Figure the largest non-bank provider of home equity financing in the U.S. Figure’s ecosystem also includes YLDS, an SEC-registered yield-bearing stablecoin that operates as a tokenized money market fund, and several other products and platforms that are reshaping consumer finance and capital markets.

We’re proud to be recognized as one of Forbes’ Most Innovative Fintech Startups in 2025 and Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies in Finance and Personal Finance.

About The Role

Figure is excited to be growing our businesses and creating new teams. We are looking for curious, innovative, and collaborative team members. Engineering is at the heart of the action, building out our blockchain protocol and direct-to-consumer products that will transform the financial services industry. Everything is developed from scratch, and every engineer has a significant impact on the team and the company's growth.

The XX team at Figure is responsible for all software development once a loan application is cleared for funding. Systems include cash movement, loan validation, loan servicing, loan sales, and all blockchain interactions.
