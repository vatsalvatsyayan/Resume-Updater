About the job

The simple task of buying software, services, or tools at work has become hopelessly complicated at even the most innovative companies in the world. Today, enterprises spend $120T+ per year globally (>30 times larger than annual consumer e-commerce spend) and rely on vendors more than ever before to run their businesses.

Our cofounders started Zip in 2020 to address this seemingly intractable problem with a purpose-built procurement platform that provides a simple, consumer-grade user experience. Within the last 4 years, Zip has created a new category and developed the leading solution in this $50B+ TAM space. Today, the world’s leading companies like OpenAI, Snowflake, Anthropic, Coinbase, and Prudential rely on Zip to manage billions of dollars in spend.

We have a world-class team coming from category-defining companies like Airbnb, Meta, Stripe, Salesforce, Apple, and Google. With a $2.2 billion valuation and $370 million in funding from Y Combinator, Tiger Global, BOND, DST Global, and CRV, we’re focused on developing cutting-edge technology, expanding into new global markets, and—above all–driving incredible value for our customers. Join us!

Your Role

The Identity team is responsible for the platforms that manage user access and data confidentiality for customers. As a Software Engineer on the team, you will take on a dynamic role, developing core customer-facing identity products, such as authentication/authorization, user account security, and encryption key management. We move quickly to solve a wide range of complex technical and product challenges. While we are an experienced team that can provide constant guidance and mentorship, we value engineers who can autonomously scope and solve complex technical challenges.

You will


Design and build product features for enterprise customers, such as AI-powered anomaly detection for payment fraud and account takeovers, granular access control and identity management, and bring-your-own-key encryption.
Work closely with cross-functional product and customer-facing teams to understand requirements and ship thoughtful solutions.
Work closely with our customers’ security teams (e.g., Discover, Snowflake, and Anthropic) to understand their needs and learn how they assess risk.
Build guardrails, tooling, frameworks, and automation to empower software engineers to ship secure changes and prevent vulnerabilities from reaching the main branch.
Design and build scalable frontend applications and components.



Qualifications


Minimum 1+ years of experience in a software engineering role. This role requires software development experience.
Experience with web application and API development in production environments. At Zip, our stack includes Python, Typescript, React, and GraphQL.
Experience in enterprise SaaS, fintech, software security best practices, and compliance frameworks is a bonus, but not required.



The salary range for this role is $150,000 - $180,000. The salary for this position is determined based on a variety of job-related factors that may include location, relevant experience, education, or particular skills and expertise.
