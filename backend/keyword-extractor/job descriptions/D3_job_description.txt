About D3

D3 is building the world’s first purpose-built blockchain for DomainFi—bringing domain tokenization and DeFi primitives to a massive, rapidly growing $350B+ real-world asset class. We’re revolutionizing how existing and future domain names are owned, traded, and leveraged in the digital economy.

Our elite team is stacked with industry veterans who have spent the last three decades shaping the internet, from pioneering domain name monetization to architecting key internet protocols to launching and running major TLDs like .xyz, .inc, .tv, and .link. With a proven track record of innovation and success, we’re now redefining what’s possible in the domain space.

We recently closed a $25M Series A led by Paradigm - one of the best investors in the industry. This will help fuel our mission to bring domains fully on-chain and unlock new financial possibilities for one of the internet’s most valuable asset classes.

We’re based in Los Angeles, with team members all over the world. We’re looking for driven, talented builders to help build a trillion-dollar DomainFi economy. Join us!
