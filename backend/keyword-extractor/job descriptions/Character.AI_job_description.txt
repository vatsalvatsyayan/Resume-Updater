About The Role And Team

We are scaling personalized AI to billions of users by reimagining how people discover, engage with, and return to intelligent characters. This requires blending product craftsmanship with growth experimentation and an instinct for user behavior. We’re looking for a skilled engineer who is excited to build elegant, high-impact user experiences that drive growth. If you thrive at the intersection of design, data, and iteration—and care deeply about quality and performance—we’d love to work with you.

What you’ll do


Build fast, intuitive, and visually polished user-facing features that drive user acquisition, activation, and retention. 
Design and run growth experiments that span product surfaces—from onboarding to virality to re-engagement loops. 
Partner closely with design and product to translate high-level ideas into delightful and performant interfaces. 
Collaborate with data science to define success metrics, analyze experiment outcomes, and identify opportunities. 
Maintain a high bar for code quality, UI/UX polish, and performance across mobile and web platforms. 
Help shape and evolve the team’s experimentation platform and tooling to improve iteration velocity. 


Who you are


Experience as a Front-End or Full-Stack Software Engineer, ideally in consumer product environments. 
Deep understanding of Typescript, CSS, React, React Native, HTML, and modern front end design patterns and best practices. 
Comfortable working across the stack and contributing to backend services as needed—especially in Python or Golang. 
Demonstrated experience shipping user-facing features that drove measurable growth or engagement. 
Analytical mindset with experience working alongside data teams using metrics and experimentation to inform decisions. 
Proven ability to work in a fast-paced development environment and deliver timely results. 
Excellent communication and collaboration skills across disciplines. 


Nice to Have


Background in mobile-first or AI-powered consumer products. 
Prior exposure to zero-to-one product development or startup environments. 
Interest in user psychology, onboarding, and viral loops.
