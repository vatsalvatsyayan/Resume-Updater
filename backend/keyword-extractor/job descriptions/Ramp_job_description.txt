About Ramp

At Ramp, we’re rethinking how modern finance teams function in the age of AI. We believe AI isn’t just the next big wave. It’s the new foundation for how business gets done. We’re investing in that future — and in the people bold enough to build it.

Ramp is a financial operations platform designed to save companies time and money. Our all-in-one solution combines payments, corporate cards, vendor management, procurement, travel booking, and automated bookkeeping with built-in intelligence to maximize the impact of every dollar and hour spent. More than 50,000 businesses, from family-owned farms to e-commerce giants to space startups, have saved $10B and 27.5M hours with Ramp. Founded in 2019, Ramp powers the fastest-growing corporate card and bill payment platform in America, and enables over $100 billion in purchases each year.

Ramp’s investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Thrive Capital, Sands Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Redpoint, and ICONIQ, as well as over 100 angel investors who were founders or executives of leading companies. The Ramp team comprises talented leaders from leading financial services and fintech companies—Stripe, Affirm, Goldman Sachs, American Express, Mastercard, Visa, Capital One—as well as technology companies such as Meta, Uber, Netflix, Twitter, Dropbox, and Instacart.

Ramp has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list and LinkedIn’s Top U.S. Startups for more than 3 years, as well as the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, and TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Companies.
