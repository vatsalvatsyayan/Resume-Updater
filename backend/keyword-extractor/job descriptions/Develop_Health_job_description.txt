About the job

Develop Health is on a mission to use AI to radically accelerate access to life-saving medications. By automating complex, manual healthcare processes—like benefit verification and prior authorization—we’ve grown from $0 to >$10M in annual recurring revenue in less than 2 years, and currently help more than 400,000 new patients every month.

We’re partnering with some of the largest pharmacy benefit managers and payers in the nation, revolutionizing how healthcare interactions occur by eliminating human delays and inefficiencies. Our small, elite team of founders and engineers have previously launched and exited successful healthcare startups including Rupa Health and Canvas Medical. We are now scaling rapidly following a major funding round.

About The Role

We’re hiring a Software Engineer to design and ship the systems and interfaces that power our AI-driven healthcare platform. You’ll work across the stack—building robust backend APIs, designing seamless integrations with our AI models, and creating intuitive frontend experiences that make complex healthcare processes effortless.

You’ll collaborate directly with our AI and Product teams to bring frontier LLM capabilities into real-world workflows, ensuring performance, usability, and reliability. Moreover, you'll be surrounded by a team of talented Engineers, offering an unrivalled opportunity to develop your career.

Working on-site in Menlo Park at least three days a week, you’ll be part of a team that owns major product surfaces end-to-end, helping define the foundation for our next stage of growth.

What You’ll Do – Impact In Your First 3–6 Months:


Build and scale Python-based backend systems and APIs that power AI-driven automation in healthcare.
Develop modern frontend experiences using React + TypeScript, enabling clinicians and operations teams to easily leverage AI insights.
Integrate and orchestrate LLM services in production environments, optimizing for performance, reliability, and user experience.
Collaborate with AI and product teams to refine workflows, gather user feedback, and translate insights into product improvements.
Enhance observability, testing, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure rapid, confident iteration.


What You’ll Own – Driving Growth Beyond 12 Months


Scale our full-stack architecture to support 100× transaction growth and real-time analytics.
Shape the data and API layer that powers both internal analytics and external integrations.
Drive continuous improvement in frontend performance and developer tooling.


What You’ll Bring On Day 1


1+ years of experience building and shipping production full-stack software.
Proficiency in Python, TypeScript, and React.
Experience designing, building, and maintaining APIs and scalable backend services.
Strong product intuition and attention to detail in building user-facing experiences.
A self-directed, ownership-driven approach—you prioritize outcomes over process.
Excellent collaboration and communication skills across engineering, AI, and product teams.
Availability to work on-site in Menlo Park at least three days per week.


What You’ll Need To Learn Quickly


How our platform supports benefit verification and prior authorization workflows, and how to translate healthcare complexity into clear, user-friendly product experiences.
How our AI systems integrate with product features to automate and accelerate healthcare operations.
How to build secure, reliable software that operates within healthcare data constraints.


Bonus Points


Experience building AI-powered or automation-heavy products.
Exposure to health-tech or clinical data systems (EHRs, payers, or pharmacy integrations).
Startup or early-stage experience; a founder mindset and bias for impact.
Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS), orchestration, and DevOps tooling.


What We Offer


Competitive salary + meaningful equity in a company growing 10× year-over-year.
Health, dental, and vision coverage; flexible PTO.
High-end workstation & tooling budget.
The chance to build software that directly improves access to care for hundreds of thousands of patients.
