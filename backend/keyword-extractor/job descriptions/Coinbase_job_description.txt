About the job

Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.

To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.

Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.

 

The AI Tools team is dedicated to rapidly accelerating the adoption of AI and agentic workflows for engineers at Coinbase. We achieve this by delivering high-quality tools and foundational primitives that empower teams to automate their work and unlock significant productivity gains across the engineering lifecycle. Our goal is to transform successful AI experiments into enterprise-grade tools, making AI an indispensable partner for every engineer.

What you'll do:
Build cutting-edge infrastructure and tools that empower AI-driven developer workflows.
Create and deploy autonomous AI agents that integrate effortlessly with essential dev tools like GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Figma.
Collaborate across engineering, product, and design to ship AI products that 10x productivity and redefine developer experiences.
Prototype swiftly, iterate rapidly, and optimize for real-world performance, scalability, and user delight.
Package and deliver robust AI solutions through user-friendly SDKs, APIs, and intuitive interfaces.
What we're looking for:
Proficiency in Python, Go, or TypeScript/Node.
Experience orchestrating AI agents and automating workflows.
Familiarity with observability tools for AI/ML systems.
Practical experience with Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD processes.
A knack for rapid prototyping and shipping robust, production-ready code.
Nice to Haves:
Shipped agentic workflows or built LLM-powered systems (Claude Code, LangChain, etc.).
Contributed to open-source AI or agent frameworks.
Integrated AI technologies into popular dev and collaboration tools.
Startup or zero-to-one product experience.
Deep understanding of reasoning, planning, and memory architectures in autonomous agents.
