About the job

Join the DataAnnotation team and contribute to developing cutting-edge AI systems, while enjoying the flexibility of remote work and setting your own schedule.

We are looking for proficient programmers to help advance AI development. As a member of DataAnnotation’s coding team, you’ll be part of a growing community of over 100,000 professionals — including front-end, back-end, full-stack, machine learning, and other engineers — who are driving real-world impact in AI development.

Our platform offers an engaging blend of flexibility and challenge: you’ll work closely with state-of-the-art AI models to take on programming tasks that include creating and solving challenging coding problems, building beautiful apps with rich functionality, and synthesizing insights through data analysis and visualization. Your work directly contributes to refining intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and evolve. Some team members fit this work alongside a full-time role, while others treat it as their primary focus, choosing projects and schedules that align with their availability and goals.

To get started, once you sign up for an account, you'll take a short assessment (this serves as our version of an interview). If you pass that assessment, you’ll receive an email confirmation, and paid work will become available to you through our platform.

Flexible schedule: choose which projects you take on and when you work.
Competitive pay: projects are paid hourly, starting at $50+ USD per hour. Opportunities for higher-paying projects are available with strong performance.
Impact: help shape the future of AI technologies.


Responsibilities


Design and solve diverse coding problems used to train AI systems with an emphasis on Android development.
Write clear, high-quality code snippets and detailed explanations.
Evaluate AI-generated code for accuracy, performance, and clarity.
Provide feedback that directly shapes the next generation of AI models.


Qualifications


Fluency in English (native or bilingual level).
Preferred experience in Kotlin.
Proficiency in at least one of the following programming languages or frameworks: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C#, C++, React, Go, Java, or Swift.
Excellent writing and grammar skills.
A bachelor’s degree (completed or in progress).
