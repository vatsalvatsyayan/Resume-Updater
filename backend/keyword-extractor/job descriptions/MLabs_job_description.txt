About the job

Software Engineer (New Grad/Entry-Level)

Full-time | On-site 

Location: San Francisco, CA

We are a rapidly growing, cash-flow positive technology company modernizing a $12 trillion global industry. We are seeking a world-class Software Engineer to join our team, focusing on simplifying complex systems, unifying fragmented data, and building high-scale backend infrastructure. This is a unique opportunity to join an early-stage company with de-risked fundamentals and high impact potential.

This role involves tackling massive technical challenges by connecting and unifying disparate, legacy software systems. You will build the foundational infrastructure and user-facing applications that automate core industry workflows, providing tremendous value to customers.

Role Responsibilities:


Develop and maintain high-scale backend systems that handle millions of API requests daily, focusing on performance, reliability, and speed
Unify fragmented systems by defining a single, scalable standard for data models, authentication, and features like filtering and pagination across dozens of integrations
Innovate solutions for connecting with legacy, on-premise systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based) to provide secure, fast, and reliable cloud-based access, often requiring creative approaches like building real-time communication layers (e.g., using WebSockets) where native APIs do not exist
Build full-stack applications (including front-end UIs) that "dog-food" our own APIs, ensuring the highest level of API quality and performance
Focus on Operational Excellence, creating a reliable API layer on top of inherently unstable legacy systems, enforced by strict SLAs
Work across the technical stack, utilizing Postgres, Redis, and AWS infrastructure (CDK, EC2)
Contribute to a culture of constant iteration, shipping code daily based on direct customer feedback


Requirements


We are looking for an ambitious, independent engineer who thrives in a fast-paced, high-ownership environment
0 - 1 years of post-graduation experience as a Backend or Full-Stack Software Engineer. This is an ideal role for a high-potential new graduate
Must be able to work independently and take full ownership of tasks with minimal supervision or guidance
Experience or strong familiarity with our core Tech Stack: Redis, Postgres, and AWS (CDK, EC2)
Strong desire to simplify complex technical problems and unify fragmented data sets
Commitment to high-velocity development and iterative product building based on customer needs


Work Policy:


This is a fully on-site position in San Francisco, CA, requiring attendance 5 days a week
Visa Sponsorship is available for qualified US and CAN candidates (including TN, OPT, and H1B Transfer)


Benefits

Join an experienced founding team with a strong track record (acquired by Amazon) and a company that has strategically eliminated key risks while maintaining high growth upside.


Competitive Compensation: Base salary between $130,000 - $160,000
Significant Early Equity: Own a meaningful stake with equity ranging from 0.05% - 0.20%
