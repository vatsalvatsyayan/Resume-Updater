About the job

Uare.ai, founded by Robert LoCascio (former CEO of LivePerson for 28 years), is an AI startup launched in May 2024 with a mission to empower people to do more with their memories. Uare.ai creates AI-driven personal digital twins, enabling users to preserve, share, and interact with their knowledge and stories in groundbreaking ways.

At its core is the proprietary Human Life Model (HLM), designed to process unstructured conversations and story data sets without training client data into traditional LLMs. Instead, Uare.ai leverages 3rd-party LLMs for conversations, with HLM providing structure and reasoning.

While initially focused on personal legacy and AI immortality, Uare.ai’ platform has broad B2C and B2B applications. The company has gained significant traction, featured in over 30 outlets including NBC, NPR, The New York Post, and CNET.

About The Role

We are seeking a highly skilled Machine Learning Engineer to join an early-stage, mission-driven startup that’s building cutting-edge AI-powered products for real-world human interaction. You will be responsible for designing and implementing scalable machine learning pipelines, integrating foundation models, and fine-tuning retrieval systems that deliver high-quality, context-aware responses.

What You’ll Do


Design and implement machine learning workflows that combine structured and unstructured data.
Work with state-of-the-art language models and voice technologies.
Build and optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.
Collaborate closely with product and engineering teams to turn early prototypes into production-grade systems.
Help shape the future of AI-powered human interaction products. 


What We’re Looking For


Experience in machine learning, NLP, or AI.
Strong experience with LLMs, RAG pipelines, vector databases, and prompt engineering.
Hands-on experience with cloud-based AI platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Familiarity with voice cloning, speech synthesis, or related audio ML workflows is a plus.
Excited about building 0-to-1 products in a fast-moving environment.


The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and a comprehensive benefits package.

At Uare.ai (formerly Eternos), we’re building the first platform for Individual AI - designed to protect, reflect, and amplify the uniqueness of every person.

Unlike general-purpose AIs built to absorb everyone’s data, your Individual AI is trained on you: your stories, experiences, values, knowledge, and voice. It’s not a generic assistant - it’s a digital counterpart that understands your perspective, grows with you, and stays under your control.

At the core is our proprietary Human Life Model (HLM), which transforms unstructured conversations and memories into structured intelligence that traditional LLMs cannot. Unlike others, we never train client data into third-party models. Instead, HLM provides reasoning, context, and permanence - ensuring your AI is authentic, safeguarded, and built to last.

Founded in 2024, Uare.ai has already been featured in 30+ outlets, including NBC, NPR, The New York Post, and CNET. We’re pioneering applications across consumer, prosumer, and enterprise markets - from personal legacy and coaching, to education and knowledge work.

Our mission: Discover, develop, and protect individuality in the age of AI.
