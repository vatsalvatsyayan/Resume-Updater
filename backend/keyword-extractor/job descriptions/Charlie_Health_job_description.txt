About the job

Why Charlie Health?

Millions of people across the country are navigating mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and eating disorders, but too often, they’re met with barriers to care. From limited local options and long wait times to treatment that lacks personalization, behavioral healthcare can leave people feeling unseen and unsupported.

Charlie Health exists to change that. Our mission is to connect the world to life-saving behavioral health treatment. We deliver personalized, virtual care rooted in connection—between clients and clinicians, care teams, loved ones, and the communities that support them. By focusing on people with complex needs, we’re expanding access to meaningful care and driving better outcomes from the comfort of home.

As a rapidly growing organization, we're reaching more communities every day and building a team that’s redefining what behavioral health treatment can look like. If you're ready to use your skills to drive lasting change and help more people access the care they deserve, we’d love to meet you.

About The Role

Charlie Health leads the nation in high-acuity virtual behavioral care, having delivered life-saving treatment to more than 100,000 clients nationwide. Our Therapist Success team builds the platform that powers the care itself, helping therapists deliver consistent, high-quality treatment every day.

You’ll create tools that give our therapists the right information at the right time. From organizing a client’s full care history to surfacing dynamic summaries and playbooks for each session, your work will help clinicians prepare, document, and make better decisions in real time. The systems you build will bring structure to complex clinical data, strengthen quality across our network, and ultimately make our care more effective.

If you care about building tools that empower therapists to focus on care, not clicks, this is the team for you.
