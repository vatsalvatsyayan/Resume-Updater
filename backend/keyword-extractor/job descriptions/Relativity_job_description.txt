As a Software Engineer on the Discovery team, you will design, build, and operate the next generation of AI-driven, scalable, high-performance systems that process large volumes of data. This role combines deep technical expertise with a collaborative mindset to solve complex challenges, while delivering and operating secure, scalable, and high-performance cloud-native solutions.

Participate in on-call rotations to troubleshoot and resolve production issues promptly. 
Collaborate with product managers and other engineers to deliver high-quality features.
