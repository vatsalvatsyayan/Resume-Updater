Build intelligent agents that review and reason over engineering documents, drawings, and specifications

Develop and scale our full-stack infrastructure; from document ingestion to real-time user feedback




We’re Looking For Engineers Who:




Blend strong technical depth with curiosity for AI, hardware design, and product development
Have built and shipped high impact products or tools used by real customers
Thrive in fast moving, high ownership environments where you define the “how”
