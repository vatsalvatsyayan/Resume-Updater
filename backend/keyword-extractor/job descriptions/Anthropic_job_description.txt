About Anthropic

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

We're looking for a Finance AI Engineer to help build the next generation of AI-powered tools for finance and accounting teams. You'll work at the intersection of finance operations, AI product development, and engineering—partnering closely with our Finance team to transform how finance professionals interact with data, process documents, and automate their workflows using Claude.

This role offers the opportunity to take full ownership of complex problems at the frontier of AI application in finance. You'll build Claude Skills and workflows that encode deep institutional knowledge about financial data, accounting conventions, and business logic. Your work will span both internal tools for Anthropic's finance team and insights that inform external products—directly contributing to our mission of building safe and beneficial AI systems.

In This Role You Will


Partner with Anthropic's Finance team to build Claude-powered tools that transform how finance professionals interact with data, process documents, and automate their workflows 
Embed with FP&A, accounting, and finance systems teams to identify high-value automation opportunities and translate them into production-ready AI workflows 
Design and implement systems that handle OCR, document parsing, and data extraction to transform unstructured finance documents (invoices, contracts, statements) into structured, actionable data 
Develop deep institutional knowledge of Anthropic's financial data architecture (BigQuery warehouse, accounting conventions, business logic) and encode that knowledge into AI-powered tools 
Own the full lifecycle from discovery through deployment: scoping requirements with finance users, building prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating to production 
Contribute to the underlying Finance AI platform architecture, including evaluation frameworks, scheduled workflows, and collaboration features 
Build AI-powered workflows that enable natural language queries against financial data systems, automated reporting, and document processing pipelines 
Create technical documentation and provide hands-on guidance to finance teams on how to leverage AI tools effectively 


Responsibilities


Have experience working embedded with finance or accounting teams, understanding their workflows, terminology, and pain points 
Can speak fluently about financial concepts: revenue recognition, accruals, close processes, SOX controls, FP&A reporting cycles 
Have strong software engineering fundamentals and ability to build end-to-end applications 
Have strong SQL skills and experience working with data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) to build analytical products 
Have experience with document processing (OCR), natural language processing, or working with unstructured data 
Have a track record of building trust with non-technical stakeholders and shipping products they actually use 
Thrive building prototypes or MVPs quickly and iteratively in fast-paced environments 
Are excited about AI's potential to transform knowledge work and care about building systems that are safe and beneficial 


Strong Candidates May Also Have


Experience building natural language interfaces to data systems (text-to-SQL, conversational analytics) 
Experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI application development 
Familiarity with financial data structures, accounting systems (ERP platforms like Oracle, Workday, NetSuite) 
Prior experience with financial processes including close, reporting, and compliance workflows 
Familiarity with the unique challenges of AI evaluation: measuring accuracy, handling edge cases, building user trust 
Prior experience at a high-growth startup where finance processes were still being built 


The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Annual Salary

$205,000—$265,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
