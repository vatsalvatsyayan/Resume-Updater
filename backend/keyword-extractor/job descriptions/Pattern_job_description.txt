About the job

About Pattern 

Pattern is transforming airport ground operations through AI-driven software and robotics. Our mission is to make aviation logistics efficient, predictable, and human-friendly. With tools like Pulse (our data & dispatch platform), Co-pilot (think "Uber for airport equipment dispatch"), and Pathfinder (a flexible robotic conveyor belt) we’re building the ecosystem of tools to drive airport operations. Join our team of 25+ brilliant minds in Boulder, where our culture thrives on: Autonomy | Humility | Customer Obsession | Enthusiasm | Transparency




Your Mission 

Build the intuitive, powerful interfaces that bring our cutting-edge aviation technology to life. As a key contributor to our front-end applications, you will transform complex data from our Pulse platform and robotic systems into clear, actionable user experiences for airport operations teams around the world. This is a hands-on role where your code will have an immediate impact.




Key Responsibilities

UI Development & Implementation: Write clean, functional code to build and refine user interfaces for our fleet management systems, operational dashboards, and internal tools. You'll take design concepts and turn them into fast, reliable, and responsive web applications.

User-Centric Collaboration: Work closely with full-stack developers, product managers, and end-users to understand needs and contribute to the design direction. Your focus will be on creating interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also highly usable in fast-paced, 24/7 airport environments.

Code Quality & Learning: Contribute to our codebase with a focus on quality and maintainability. Participate in code reviews to learn best practices from senior team members and help maintain our high standards as we scale.

Testing & Iteration: See your work through from development to deployment. You'll have the opportunity to test your interfaces and gather feedback, using insights to iterate and improve the user experience.

Foundational Growth: Play a key role in the foundation of our front-end systems. As our team grows, you will have the opportunity to help shape our component library, design system, and software architecture from the ground up.




Tools We Use

React | TypeScript | JavaScript (ES6+) | HTML/CSS | Git | Figma | REST/GraphQL APIs




Who You Are 

Aspiring Front-End Developer: You have 0-3 years of professional experience and a portfolio (personal or professional projects are great!) that demonstrates your skills with modern front-end technologies like React, JavaScript, and CSS. A degree in CS/Design is a plus, but not required.

Quick Learner with a Can-Do Attitude: You are energized by a challenge and thrive in a fast-paced environment. You may not know everything, but you are resourceful, eager to learn, and unafraid to ask questions.

User-Interface Craftsman: You have a keen eye for clean, functional design and a passion for creating great user experiences. You care about the details—from pixel-perfect layouts to smooth interactions.

Collaborative Team Player: You value humility and enthusiasm. You enjoy working with others, giving and receiving feedback constructively, and contributing to a positive and inclusive team culture.

Mission-Driven: You are excited to apply your skills to tough problems in the physical world. The idea of building software that helps move planes and baggage more efficiently gets you out of bed in the morning.




Why Join Pattern?

Build the Future: Shape the user interfaces for the core tech stack used in airports worldwide. Your work will have a direct, visible impact on how people travel.

Mentorship & Growth: Get hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology and learn from a talented, supportive team. We are committed to your professional development.

Culture of Excellence: Work with top-tier talent who value humility and hustle.

Boulder Lifestyle & Perks: Our office is nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains with access to hiking, climbing, and skiing. We offer unlimited PTO, health benefits, hybrid flexibility, a dog-friendly office, and all the snacks you can eat.

At Pattern we are committed to being a fun, groundbreaking, and inclusive place to work. We strongly encourage engineers from BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to apply.
