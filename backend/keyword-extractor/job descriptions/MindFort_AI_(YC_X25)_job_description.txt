About the job

About Us

MindFort is an AI-powered penetration testing platform that delivers human-level security testing at machine speed. We're building fully autonomous AI agents that can find, exploit, and patch complex vulnerabilities in web applications at massive scale.

Our agents think and act like human penetration testers: they analyze targets, collaborate, and exploit weaknesses — but with the speed and scale only AI can achieve.

Security teams are already falling behind with outdated tools and manual processes. AI-generated code is flooding the world faster than humans can secure it. MindFort is closing that gap. Our platform will be critical for organizations building with AI and will redefine how offensive security is done.

About The Role

We’re hiring a Software Engineer – Backend Engineering with a strong focus on backend and AI. You’ll help architect and scale our AI Security Agent systems from the ground up. This is a high-impact, high-ownership role: as one of our earliest engineers, you’ll shape not just our product, but also our engineering culture and standards.

You’ll join a high-trust, high-velocity team where decisions are fast, responsibilities are broad, and your work will have an immediate effect on developer experience and product performance

Key Responsibilities


Design and build end-to-end applications using modern LLM frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, or custom).
Architect and maintain scalable backend systems (Python, APIs, Postgres, Docker, Kubernetes).
Orchestrate reasoning, prompt flows, and memory mechanisms to build reliable AI agents.
Integrate AI models into production environments with real users at scale.
Write clean, maintainable backend code and build complex features with performance in mind.
Identify and resolve bottlenecks to keep systems fast and resilient.


Qualifications::


Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science (or equivalent experience).
