About The Company

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.

We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.

Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.

The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.

ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.

Engineering at Valon

Our engineering team is here to power the software ecosystem to disrupt one of the most outdated and regulated spaces in the financial sector - the mortgage industry. We’ve built out the foundation of a modern mortgage servicing platform that can accurately handle billions of dollars at scale, but we’re just getting started. At Valon, we want you to do the best work of your life. You'll be surrounded by a tight-knit community of exceptional people from places like Stripe, Jane Street, Meta, and Google who care deeply about their work and each other. Our problem space is complex, but you’ll get a lot of autonomy so that you can learn quickly, execute effectively, and deliver the highest level of business impact. Our tech stack is built on Python, React, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform.

Our headquarters are in New York City, and this year, we’re excited to open a new office in San Francisco. Plus, we fully support remote work!

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance.

We’re re-architecting the largest and most complex layers of the global economy—starting with mortgage servicing, a $20B+ market that touches 50M borrowers and governs $13T in debt. For decades, this infrastructure has been powered by pre-internet software and manual workflows. We've rebuilt it from the ground up.

Our platform, ValonOS, unifies the critical systems behind how money moves—multi-party accounting, payment flows, workflow orchestration, auditability, and workforce management—into a single, programmable layer. Built to run regulated enterprises at scale, it’s designed for an AI-enabled future where automation, accuracy, and transparency are non-negotiable.

Servicing is our beachhead. The opportunity ahead: power the full financial lifecycle with a single intelligent system of record—transforming trillion-dollar industries where precision and compliance are as vital as speed.

Valon is headquartered in New York City with a new office in San Francisco. We’re hiring across engineering, product, design, operations, and go-to-market. If you want to work on mission-critical problems with massive real-world impact, join us.
