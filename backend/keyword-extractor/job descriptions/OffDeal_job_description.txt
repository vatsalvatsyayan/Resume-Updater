About the job

OffDeal is the world’s first AI-native investment bank for small businesses. Instead of selling AI to Goldman Sachs, we’re building what Goldman itself would have looked like if it launched in 2025.

Wall Street's playbook works well, but only for billion-dollar deals - it breaks where most businesses actually exist. Traditional firms run oversized teams on outdated software, making smaller M&A transactions uneconomical. This leaves millions of small business owners with nowhere to turn for the most important sale of their lives… Until now.

Our engineers built software to automate 80%+ of analyst work with AI, so our in-house bankers can focus where it counts - on earning owners’ trust and closing deals.

We recently closed a $12M Series A ($17M in total funding) from Radical Ventures and Y Combinator and are scaling really fast. In less than a year, our team has already launched over 30 sell-side M&A transactions and has delivered numerous life-changing exits to our clients - and we’re just getting started.
