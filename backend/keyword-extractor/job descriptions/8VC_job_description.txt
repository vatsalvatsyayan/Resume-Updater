About the job

New Grad, Software Engineer

Location: San Francisco

Company: Thorin

Stage: Seed | Incubated at 8VC

About Thorin

Thorin is an Applied AI company born out of 8VC’s Build program, focused on redefining how work gets done inside modern organizations.

We build proactive, long-horizon AI agents that continuously observe work across Slack, email, meetings, and documents—and take action so nothing falls through the cracks.

Unlike traditional AI tools that wait to be prompted, Thorin creates a real-time digital twin of how a business actually operates. This enables automation, coordination, and insight over months and years—not just single tasks.

Backed by 8VC and built with product vision from Joe Lonsdale, Thorin is building foundational infrastructure for agentic, AI-powered productivity. Thorin follows 8VC incubations such as Affinity, Addepar, and Saronic.

About The Role

We’re hiring a New Grad Software Engineer to help build and scale Thorin’s core product. This role is designed for strong generalists early in their careers who want to work across the stack, learn quickly, and ship real features used by real customers.

You’ll work closely with senior engineers and the founding team to build user-facing functionality, backend systems, and AI-powered workflows. This is a hands-on role with meaningful ownership, mentorship, and exposure to product and customers from day one.

What You’ll Do


Build and ship product features used by customers, from idea to production
Work across the stack, including the core AI system
Collaborate closely with designers, product, and founders to iterate quickly
Learn how to build and scale software in a zero-to-one startup environment


What We’re Looking For


New grad (or recent graduate) in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field
Strong programming fundamentals and comfort working in at least one modern language
Interest in full-stack development (frontend + backend)
Product-minded: you care about usability, quality, and real-world impact
Comfortable learning quickly, taking feedback, and working in ambiguity
Excited about startups, ownership, and building from scratch


Nice to Have (Not Required)


Familiarity with building and evaluating AI-powered applications
Exposure to backend systems, APIs, or cloud infrastructure
Internships, side projects, or research related to software or AI


Team & Why Thorin


Work directly with a small, highly driven founding team
Direct exposure to customers, product decisions, and company strategy
Learn from and collaborate with Joe Lonsdale, who remains deeply involved in product and hiring
High-ownership environment with real responsibility early in your career
Backed by one of the strongest early-stage venture platforms in the industry
