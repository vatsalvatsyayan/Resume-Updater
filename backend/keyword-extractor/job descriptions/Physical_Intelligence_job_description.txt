Who We Are

Physical Intelligence is building general-purpose AI for the physical world. Running our robot fleet efficiently is core to our mission: it drives data collection, evaluation throughput, and research velocity.

As an Ops Engineer, you’ll own the full-stack systems that operators and shift leads rely on every single day, from dashboards and scheduling workflows to alerting, metadata management, and task/eval interfaces. You’ll work directly on the floor with operators and task designers to understand friction points, then turn those insights into fast, intuitive, reliable tools.

This is a practical, product-focused engineering role at the intersection of UI, backend logic, and real-world robot operations.

The Team

The Operations Team implements on-the-ground manifestation of PI’s AI. They manage the software interfaces and tools needed to solve a wide diversity of problems such as coordinating a robot fleet with human operators, augmenting data with annotations, and running experiments to evaluate the performance of AI models.

In This Role You Will


Build Interfaces: Implement fast, ergonomic GUIs (React/TypeScript) for operators, shift leads, and internal workflows.
Backend Development: Build APIs and services (Python/FastAPI/Flask, SQL/NoSQL) powering scheduling, alerting, metadata management, and task lifecycle tools.
Operational Workflow Design: Translate on-the-floor workflows into clean abstractions that reduce manual effort and mistakes.
Automation: Create proactive alerts, automated scheduling logic, and exception-driven workflows that reduce human overhead.
Metadata & Visualization: Build tools for surfacing key metadata, task definitions, per-robot state, station context, performance metrics, in clear, actionable views.
Hands-On Collaboration: Work directly with operators, shift leads, and task designers to identify bottlenecks and rapidly iterate on solutions.


What We Hope You’ll Bring


Strong frontend experience (React/TypeScript, modern UI patterns).
Solid backend development skills (Python, FastAPI/Flask, SQL/NoSQL).
Experience building tools, dashboards, or workflow-heavy applications.
Strong product instincts: ability to map real workflows into clean, intuitive software.
Comfortable working hands-on with end users and iterating quickly.


Bonus Points If You Have


Experience with real-time systems, robotics, or IoT.
Alerting systems, workflow engines, scheduling logic.
Data visualization or building metadata-heavy dashboards.
UX design sensibilities for operator-facing tools.
