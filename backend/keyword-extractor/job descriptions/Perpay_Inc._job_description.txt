About the job

About Us:

Perpay is a certified B Corp and Philadelphia’s most impactful growth-stage startup. We are driven by a mission to significantly improve the financial stability of everyday Americans. For the past decade, we have established strong product-market fit and a profitable, efficient operating model across a suite of products, positioning Perpay as the premier financial partner for consumers with subprime credit.

With over 500,000 customers who have utilized more than $1 billion in spending power, we are at a pivotal moment. We are scaling our operations, building new offerings, and deepening our impact. We are looking for teammates eager to join us on this journey.

Our venture partners include First Round Capital and L Catterton.

Products we’ve built to make an impact:


Perpay Marketplace: Combines interest-free payments and modern e-commerce to reduce cost of ownership and promote healthy repayment behavior. 
Perpay+: Leverages Marketplace repayment history to help members monitor and build credit with all 3 credit bureaus. 
Perpay Credit Card: Expands access to the flexibility and benefits of a World Mastercard by removing common barriers like high security deposits and low approval odds. 


Our team thrives on in-person collaboration, operating from our unique center-city Philadelphia office. This comfortable "home away from home" space offers river views and fosters rapid product development, strong relationships, and career growth. The energy from achieving big wins is palpable here. While we primarily work in the office, we offer sensible flexibility for personal needs, such as sick children or urgent errands, and coordinate official remote weeks around major holidays. If you are passionate about a meaningful mission, collaboration, equity, and generous perks, Perpay is the best place to be in Philadelphia right now.

About the Role:

We are looking for motivated graduates to join our Software Engineering team in 2026! You’ll contribute to our codebase, test & release features into production, and collaborate with other teams like product, design, data science, analytics, and operations. The ideal candidate has software development internship experience and is enthusiastic about learning and growing! We're particularly interested in working with candidates excited about joining a mission-driven startup. On our team, you’ll sharpen your skills, learn new tools alongside other new graduates, and learn from experienced engineers. Plus, our team organizes events and social gatherings outside of work hours. We believe having a fun and engaging work environment is essential to fostering a positive company culture and creating a strong foundation for career growth.

Much of our team is fullstack, so we look for team members excited to learn new technologies and work across all stacks, even if it’s not something you’ve done before! Our tech stack: Javascript, React, React Native, Redux, Python, Django, Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, Terraform, and more.

Our greatest strength is our people, and we’d love for you to be one of them!

Responsibilities:


Develop, test, and release features for our customer-facing and internal platforms alongside the engineering team
Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code
Collaborate cross-functionally to develop efficient and user-friendly solutions to support the complex needs of our business
Actively participate in design reviews, code reviews, and discussions to improve our software architecture and implement efficient processes within our engineering team


What You’ll Bring:


Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree or higher or a recent graduate studying Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field 
1 to 2 previous Software Engineering internships with a focus on fullstack software development
Experience with at least one backend application framework such as Django or Flask
Experience with frontend technologies such as React, Angular, or Vue.js
Knowledge of RESTful API design and integration
Experience with Python or another dynamically typed language
A strong focus on writing and deploying clear, readable, testable code
Ability to pick up new technologies quickly, with software engineering fundamentals being valued more than familiarity with specific tools or languages
Eagerness to learn, grow, and seek feedback from team members
Strong communication skills


Even if you don't check all the boxes, please apply if interested. You might be exactly what we're looking for!

What We’ll Bring to Full-time Team Members:


Meaningful compensation and equity
Premium medical benefits (fully paid base plan, and very reasonable premium for the buy-up option)
4% employer 401k match
Unlimited PTO policy
 Remote weeks around major holidays + extra holiday on weekends like MDW and LDW
