About the job

About Lapis

Every marketing team runs the same way. Ahrefs or Semrush for SEO. Google Analytics or PostHog for traffic. Meta Ads Manager, LinkedIn Campaign Manager and Google Ads for paid. Klaviyo or Mailchimp for email. Canva or Figma for design. Google Docs or Notion for managing it all.




Each tool is good at one thing. But none of them talk to each other.




Your writing tool doesn't know what keywords you're going after. Your ad platform has no idea what's working on the organic side. Your analytics are completely separate from your content calendar. Your design tool doesn't know your campaign goals. You're constantly copying data between tools, switching between 10 different tabs, recreating context, and explaining the same thing to different systems.




When it's time to decide what to write next or where to spend ad budget, you're left guessing. The data that would help make the answer obvious is sitting in another tool you'd have to log into, export from, and manually piece together before going back to the original platform and performing the action.




About the Role

As a SWE at Lapis, you’ll own our core product and infra systems that directly shape how our customers grow their businesses. You’ll be able to work on high-leverage problems across data pipelines, agent workflows, and products with a small and tight-knit team of 5 people, with a high degree of autonomy. We wake up excited every day to see how our product is being used by our users and their businesses, and we’re looking for someone who is as obsessed as we are at creating a best-in-class experience for them.




What You’ll Do

Build the foundational backend and data infrastructure that everything else at Lapis will sit on
Own critical paths across data ingestion, analytics, and agent execution pipelines
Ship production systems quickly, then harden and scale them as usage grows
Debug gnarly real-world issues across distributed systems, APIs, and external integrations
Collaborate directly with founders and early customers to shape product and architecture
Help define how we build, test, deploy, and operate software as the company scales




Who You Are

2+ years of professional software engineering experience, ideally in fast-moving product teams
Strong fundamentals in TypeScript and building production APIs
Comfortable working across databases, background jobs, and data pipelines
Excited by ambiguous problems and figuring out what to build, not just how to build it
Able to move quickly without losing sight of code quality and system design
Curious, self-directed, and motivated by building things that real users depend on




Extra Awesome

Familiarity with ads platforms, analytics tooling, or growth experimentation
Experience with Serverless GPU cloud infrastructure (Modal), observability, and CI/CD
Prior startup experience or building 0→1 products




Compensation

The annual US base salary range for this role is: $150,000 – $200,000, plus equity and benefits.
